# `sys` — System-specific parameters and functions

---

This module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the
interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. It is
always available. Unless explicitly noted otherwise, all variables are read-only.

### sys.abi_info

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.15.

An object containing information about the ABI of the currently running
Python interpreter.
It should include information that affect the CPython ABI in ways that
require a specific build of the interpreter chosen from variants that can
co-exist on a single machine.
For example, it does not encode the base OS (Linux or Windows), but does
include pointer size since some systems support both 32- and 64-bit builds.
The available entries are the same on all platforms;
e.g. *pointer_size* is available even on 64-bit-only architectures.

The following attributes are available:

#### abi_info.pointer_bits

The width of pointers in bits, as an integer,
equivalent to `8 * sizeof(void *)`.
Usually, this is  `32` or `64`.

#### abi_info.free_threaded

A Boolean indicating whether the interpreter was built with
[free threading](../glossary.md#term-free-threading) support.
This reflects either the presence of the [`--disable-gil`](../using/configure.md#cmdoption-disable-gil)
`configure` option (on Unix)
or setting the `DisableGil` property (on Windows).

#### abi_info.debug

A Boolean indicating whether the interpreter was built in
[debug mode](../using/configure.md#debug-build).
This reflects either the presence of the [`--with-pydebug`](../using/configure.md#cmdoption-with-pydebug)
`configure` option (on Unix)
or the `Debug` configuration (on Windows).

#### abi_info.byteorder

A string indicating the native byte order,
either `'big'` or `'little'`.
This is the same as the [`byteorder`](#sys.byteorder) attribute.

### sys.abiflags

On POSIX systems where Python was built with the standard `configure`
script, this contains the ABI flags as specified by [**PEP 3149**](https://peps.python.org/pep-3149/).

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.2.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.8: Default flags became an empty string (`m` flag for pymalloc has been
removed).

[Availability](intro.md#availability): Unix.

### sys.addaudithook(hook)

Append the callable *hook* to the list of active auditing hooks for the
current (sub)interpreter.

When an auditing event is raised through the [`sys.audit()`](#sys.audit) function, each
hook will be called in the order it was added with the event name and the
tuple of arguments. Native hooks added by [`PySys_AddAuditHook()`](../c-api/sys.md#c.PySys_AddAuditHook) are
called first, followed by hooks added in the current (sub)interpreter.  Hooks
can then log the event, raise an exception to abort the operation,
or terminate the process entirely.

Note that audit hooks are primarily for collecting information about internal
or otherwise unobservable actions, whether by Python or libraries written in
Python. They are not suitable for implementing a “sandbox”. In particular,
malicious code can trivially disable or bypass hooks added using this
function. At a minimum, any security-sensitive hooks must be added using the
C API [`PySys_AddAuditHook()`](../c-api/sys.md#c.PySys_AddAuditHook) before initialising the runtime, and any
modules allowing arbitrary memory modification (such as [`ctypes`](ctypes.md#module-ctypes)) should
be completely removed or closely monitored.

Calling [`sys.addaudithook()`](#sys.addaudithook) will itself raise an auditing event
named `sys.addaudithook` with no arguments. If any
existing hooks raise an exception derived from [`RuntimeError`](exceptions.md#RuntimeError), the
new hook will not be added and the exception suppressed. As a result,
callers cannot assume that their hook has been added unless they control
all existing hooks.

See the [audit events table](audit_events.md#audit-events) for all events raised by
CPython, and [**PEP 578**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0578/) for the original design discussion.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.8.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.8.1: Exceptions derived from [`Exception`](exceptions.md#Exception) but not [`RuntimeError`](exceptions.md#RuntimeError)
are no longer suppressed.

**CPython implementation detail:** When tracing is enabled (see [`settrace()`](#sys.settrace)), Python hooks are only
traced if the callable has a `__cantrace__` member that is set to a
true value. Otherwise, trace functions will skip the hook.

### sys.argv

The list of command line arguments passed to a Python script. `argv[0]` is the
script name (it is operating system dependent whether this is a full pathname or
not).  If the command was executed using the [`-c`](../using/cmdline.md#cmdoption-c) command line option to
the interpreter, `argv[0]` is set to the string `'-c'`.  If no script name
was passed to the Python interpreter, `argv[0]` is the empty string.

To loop over the standard input, or the list of files given on the
command line, see the [`fileinput`](fileinput.md#module-fileinput) module.

See also [`sys.orig_argv`](#sys.orig_argv).

#### NOTE
On Unix, command line arguments are passed by bytes from OS.  Python decodes
them with filesystem encoding and “surrogateescape” error handler.
When you need original bytes, you can get it by
`[os.fsencode(arg) for arg in sys.argv]`.

<a id="auditing"></a>

### sys.audit(event, \*args)

<a id="index-2"></a>

Raise an auditing event and trigger any active auditing hooks.
*event* is a string identifying the event, and *args* may contain
optional arguments with more information about the event.  The
number and types of arguments for a given event are considered a
public and stable API and should not be modified between releases.

For example, one auditing event is named `os.chdir`. This event has
one argument called *path* that will contain the requested new
working directory.

[`sys.audit()`](#sys.audit) will call the existing auditing hooks, passing
the event name and arguments, and will re-raise the first exception
from any hook. In general, if an exception is raised, it should not
be handled and the process should be terminated as quickly as
possible. This allows hook implementations to decide how to respond
to particular events: they can merely log the event or abort the
operation by raising an exception.

Hooks are added using the [`sys.addaudithook()`](#sys.addaudithook) or
[`PySys_AddAuditHook()`](../c-api/sys.md#c.PySys_AddAuditHook) functions.

The native equivalent of this function is [`PySys_Audit()`](../c-api/sys.md#c.PySys_Audit). Using the
native function is preferred when possible.

See the [audit events table](audit_events.md#audit-events) for all events raised by
CPython.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.8.

### sys.base_exec_prefix

Equivalent to [`exec_prefix`](#sys.exec_prefix), but referring to the base Python installation.

When running under [Virtual Environments](sys_path_init.md#sys-path-init-virtual-environments),
[`exec_prefix`](#sys.exec_prefix) gets overwritten to the virtual environment prefix.
[`base_exec_prefix`](#sys.base_exec_prefix), conversely, does not change, and always points to
the base Python installation.
Refer to [Virtual Environments](sys_path_init.md#sys-path-init-virtual-environments) for more information.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.3.

### sys.base_prefix

Equivalent to [`prefix`](#sys.prefix), but referring to the base Python installation.

When running under [virtual environment](venv.md#venv-def),
[`prefix`](#sys.prefix) gets overwritten to the virtual environment prefix.
[`base_prefix`](#sys.base_prefix), conversely, does not change, and always points to
the base Python installation.
Refer to [Virtual Environments](sys_path_init.md#sys-path-init-virtual-environments) for more information.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.3.

### sys.byteorder

An indicator of the native byte order.  This will have the value `'big'` on
big-endian (most-significant byte first) platforms, and `'little'` on
little-endian (least-significant byte first) platforms.

### sys.builtin_module_names

A tuple of strings containing the names of all modules that are compiled into this
Python interpreter.  (This information is not available in any other way —
`modules.keys()` only lists the imported modules.)

See also the [`sys.stdlib_module_names`](#sys.stdlib_module_names) list.

### sys.call_tracing(func, args)

Call `func(*args)`, while tracing is enabled.  The tracing state is saved,
and restored afterwards.  This is intended to be called from a debugger from
a checkpoint, to recursively debug or profile some other code.

Tracing is suspended while calling a tracing function set by
[`settrace()`](#sys.settrace) or [`setprofile()`](#sys.setprofile) to avoid infinite recursion.
`call_tracing()` enables explicit recursion of the tracing function.

### sys.copyright

A string containing the copyright pertaining to the Python interpreter.

### sys.\_clear_type_cache()

Clear the internal type cache. The type cache is used to speed up attribute
and method lookups. Use the function *only* to drop unnecessary references
during reference leak debugging.

This function should be used for internal and specialized purposes only.

#### Deprecated
Deprecated since version 3.13: Use the more general [`_clear_internal_caches()`](#sys._clear_internal_caches) function instead.

### sys.\_clear_internal_caches()

Clear all internal performance-related caches. Use this function *only* to
release unnecessary references and memory blocks when hunting for leaks.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.13.

### sys.\_current_frames()

Return a dictionary mapping each thread’s identifier to the topmost stack frame
currently active in that thread at the time the function is called. Note that
functions in the [`traceback`](traceback.md#module-traceback) module can build the call stack given such a
frame.

This is most useful for debugging deadlock:  this function does not require the
deadlocked threads’ cooperation, and such threads’ call stacks are frozen for as
long as they remain deadlocked.  The frame returned for a non-deadlocked thread
may bear no relationship to that thread’s current activity by the time calling
code examines the frame.

This function should be used for internal and specialized purposes only.

Raises an [auditing event](#auditing) `sys._current_frames` with no arguments.

### sys.\_current_exceptions()

Return a dictionary mapping each thread’s identifier to the topmost exception
currently active in that thread at the time the function is called.
If a thread is not currently handling an exception, it is not included in
the result dictionary.

This is most useful for statistical profiling.

This function should be used for internal and specialized purposes only.

Raises an [auditing event](#auditing) `sys._current_exceptions` with no arguments.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.12: Each value in the dictionary is now a single exception instance, rather
than a 3-tuple as returned from `sys.exc_info()`.

### sys.breakpointhook()

This hook function is called by built-in [`breakpoint()`](functions.md#breakpoint).  By default,
it drops you into the [`pdb`](pdb.md#module-pdb) debugger, but it can be set to any other
function so that you can choose which debugger gets used.

The signature of this function is dependent on what it calls.  For example,
the default binding (e.g. `pdb.set_trace()`) expects no arguments, but
you might bind it to a function that expects additional arguments
(positional and/or keyword).  The built-in `breakpoint()` function passes
its `*args` and `**kws` straight through.  Whatever
`breakpointhooks()` returns is returned from `breakpoint()`.

The default implementation first consults the environment variable
[`PYTHONBREAKPOINT`](../using/cmdline.md#envvar-PYTHONBREAKPOINT).  If that is set to `"0"` then this function
returns immediately; i.e. it is a no-op.  If the environment variable is
not set, or is set to the empty string, `pdb.set_trace()` is called.
Otherwise this variable should name a function to run, using Python’s
dotted-import nomenclature, e.g. `package.subpackage.module.function`.
In this case, `package.subpackage.module` would be imported and the
resulting module must have a callable named `function()`.  This is run,
passing in `*args` and `**kws`, and whatever `function()` returns,
`sys.breakpointhook()` returns to the built-in [`breakpoint()`](functions.md#breakpoint)
function.

Note that if anything goes wrong while importing the callable named by
[`PYTHONBREAKPOINT`](../using/cmdline.md#envvar-PYTHONBREAKPOINT), a [`RuntimeWarning`](exceptions.md#RuntimeWarning) is reported and the
breakpoint is ignored.

Also note that if `sys.breakpointhook()` is overridden programmatically,
[`PYTHONBREAKPOINT`](../using/cmdline.md#envvar-PYTHONBREAKPOINT) is *not* consulted.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.7.

### sys.\_debugmallocstats()

Print low-level information to stderr about the state of CPython’s memory
allocator.

If Python is [built in debug mode](../using/configure.md#debug-build) ([`configure
--with-pydebug option`](../using/configure.md#cmdoption-with-pydebug)), it also performs some expensive
internal consistency checks.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.3.

**CPython implementation detail:** This function is specific to CPython.  The exact output format is not
defined here, and may change.

### sys.dllhandle

Integer specifying the handle of the Python DLL.

[Availability](intro.md#availability): Windows.

### sys.displayhook(value)

If *value* is not `None`, this function prints `repr(value)` to
`sys.stdout`, and saves *value* in `builtins._`. If `repr(value)` is
not encodable to `sys.stdout.encoding` with `sys.stdout.errors` error
handler (which is probably `'strict'`), encode it to
`sys.stdout.encoding` with `'backslashreplace'` error handler.

`sys.displayhook` is called on the result of evaluating an [expression](../glossary.md#term-expression)
entered in an interactive Python session.  The display of these values can be
customized by assigning another one-argument function to `sys.displayhook`.

Pseudo-code:

```python3
def displayhook(value):
    if value is None:
        return
    # Set '_' to None to avoid recursion
    builtins._ = None
    text = repr(value)
    try:
        sys.stdout.write(text)
    except UnicodeEncodeError:
        bytes = text.encode(sys.stdout.encoding, 'backslashreplace')
        if hasattr(sys.stdout, 'buffer'):
            sys.stdout.buffer.write(bytes)
        else:
            text = bytes.decode(sys.stdout.encoding, 'strict')
            sys.stdout.write(text)
    sys.stdout.write("\n")
    builtins._ = value
```

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.2: Use `'backslashreplace'` error handler on [`UnicodeEncodeError`](exceptions.md#UnicodeEncodeError).

### sys.dont_write_bytecode

If this is true, Python won’t try to write `.pyc` files on the
import of source modules.  This value is initially set to `True` or
`False` depending on the [`-B`](../using/cmdline.md#cmdoption-B) command line option and the
[`PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE`](../using/cmdline.md#envvar-PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE) environment variable, but you can set it
yourself to control bytecode file generation.

### sys.\_emscripten_info

A [named tuple](../glossary.md#term-named-tuple) holding information about the environment on the
*wasm32-emscripten* platform. The named tuple is provisional and may change
in the future.

#### \_emscripten_info.emscripten_version

Emscripten version as tuple of ints (major, minor, micro), e.g. `(3, 1, 8)`.

#### \_emscripten_info.runtime

Runtime string, e.g. browser user agent, `'Node.js v14.18.2'`, or `'UNKNOWN'`.

#### \_emscripten_info.pthreads

`True` if Python is compiled with Emscripten pthreads support.

#### \_emscripten_info.shared_memory

`True` if Python is compiled with shared memory support.

[Availability](intro.md#availability): Emscripten.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.11.

### sys.pycache_prefix

If this is set (not `None`), Python will write bytecode-cache `.pyc`
files to (and read them from) a parallel directory tree rooted at this
directory, rather than from `__pycache__` directories in the source code
tree. Any `__pycache__` directories in the source code tree will be ignored
and new `.pyc` files written within the pycache prefix. Thus if you use
[`compileall`](compileall.md#module-compileall) as a pre-build step, you must ensure you run it with the
same pycache prefix (if any) that you will use at runtime.

A relative path is interpreted relative to the current working directory.

This value is initially set based on the value of the [`-X`](../using/cmdline.md#cmdoption-X)
`pycache_prefix=PATH` command-line option or the
[`PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX`](../using/cmdline.md#envvar-PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX) environment variable (command-line takes
precedence). If neither are set, it is `None`.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.8.

### sys.excepthook(type, value, traceback)

This function prints out a given traceback and exception to `sys.stderr`.

When an exception other than [`SystemExit`](exceptions.md#SystemExit) is raised and uncaught, the interpreter calls
`sys.excepthook` with three arguments, the exception class, exception
instance, and a traceback object.  In an interactive session this happens just
before control is returned to the prompt; in a Python program this happens just
before the program exits.  The handling of such top-level exceptions can be
customized by assigning another three-argument function to `sys.excepthook`.

Raise an auditing event `sys.excepthook` with arguments `hook`,
`type`, `value`, `traceback` when an uncaught exception occurs.
If no hook has been set, `hook` may be `None`. If any hook raises
an exception derived from [`RuntimeError`](exceptions.md#RuntimeError) the call to the hook will
be suppressed. Otherwise, the audit hook exception will be reported as
unraisable and `sys.excepthook` will be called.

#### SEE ALSO
The [`sys.unraisablehook()`](#sys.unraisablehook) function handles unraisable exceptions
and the [`threading.excepthook()`](threading.md#threading.excepthook) function handles exception raised
by [`threading.Thread.run()`](threading.md#threading.Thread.run).

### sys.\_\_breakpointhook_\_

### sys.\_\_displayhook_\_

### sys.\_\_excepthook_\_

### sys.\_\_unraisablehook_\_

These objects contain the original values of `breakpointhook`,
`displayhook`, `excepthook`, and `unraisablehook` at the start of the
program.  They are saved so that `breakpointhook`, `displayhook` and
`excepthook`, `unraisablehook` can be restored in case they happen to
get replaced with broken or alternative objects.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.7: \_\_breakpointhook_\_

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.8: \_\_unraisablehook_\_

### sys.exception()

This function, when called while an exception handler is executing (such as
an `except` or `except*` clause), returns the exception instance that
was caught by this handler. When exception handlers are nested within one
another, only the exception handled by the innermost handler is accessible.

If no exception handler is executing, this function returns `None`.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.11.

### sys.exc_info()

This function returns the old-style representation of the handled
exception. If an exception `e` is currently handled (so
[`exception()`](#sys.exception) would return `e`), [`exc_info()`](#sys.exc_info) returns the
tuple `(type(e), e, e.__traceback__)`.
That is, a tuple containing the type of the exception (a subclass of
[`BaseException`](exceptions.md#BaseException)), the exception itself, and a [traceback
object](../reference/datamodel.md#traceback-objects) which typically encapsulates the call
stack at the point where the exception last occurred.

<a id="index-8"></a>

If no exception is being handled anywhere on the stack, this function
return a tuple containing three `None` values.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.11: The `type` and `traceback` fields are now derived from the `value`
(the exception instance), so when an exception is modified while it is
being handled, the changes are reflected in the results of subsequent
calls to [`exc_info()`](#sys.exc_info).

### sys.exec_prefix

A string giving the site-specific directory prefix where the platform-dependent
Python files are installed; by default, this is also `'/usr/local'`.  This can
be set at build time with the `--exec-prefix` argument to the
**configure** script.  Specifically, all configuration files (e.g. the
`pyconfig.h` header file) are installed in the directory
`*exec_prefix*/lib/python*X.Y*/config`, and shared library modules are
installed in `*exec_prefix*/lib/python*X.Y*/lib-dynload`, where *X.Y*
is the version number of Python, for example `3.2`.

#### NOTE
If a [virtual environment](venv.md#venv-def) is in effect, this [`exec_prefix`](#sys.exec_prefix)
will point to the virtual environment. The value for the Python installation
will still be available, via [`base_exec_prefix`](#sys.base_exec_prefix).
Refer to [Virtual Environments](sys_path_init.md#sys-path-init-virtual-environments) for more information.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.14: When running under a [virtual environment](venv.md#venv-def),
[`prefix`](#sys.prefix) and [`exec_prefix`](#sys.exec_prefix) are now set to the virtual
environment prefix by the [path initialization](sys_path_init.md#sys-path-init),
instead of [`site`](site.md#module-site). This means that [`prefix`](#sys.prefix) and
[`exec_prefix`](#sys.exec_prefix) always point to the virtual environment, even when
[`site`](site.md#module-site) is disabled ([`-S`](../using/cmdline.md#cmdoption-S)).

### sys.executable

A string giving the absolute path of the executable binary for the Python
interpreter, on systems where this makes sense. If Python is unable to retrieve
the real path to its executable, [`sys.executable`](#sys.executable) will be an empty string
or `None`.

### sys.exit()

Raise a [`SystemExit`](exceptions.md#SystemExit) exception, signaling an intention to exit the interpreter.

The optional argument *arg* can be an integer giving the exit status
(defaulting to zero), or another type of object.  If it is an integer, zero
is considered “successful termination” and any nonzero value is considered
“abnormal termination” by shells and the like.  Most systems require it to be
in the range 0–127, and produce undefined results otherwise.  Some systems
have a convention for assigning specific meanings to specific exit codes, but
these are generally underdeveloped; Unix programs generally use 2 for command
line syntax errors and 1 for all other kinds of errors.  If another type of
object is passed, `None` is equivalent to passing zero, and any other
object is printed to [`stderr`](#sys.stderr) and results in an exit code of 1.  In
particular, `sys.exit("some error message")` is a quick way to exit a
program when an error occurs.

Since [`exit()`](constants.md#exit) ultimately “only” raises an exception, it will only exit
the process when called from the main thread, and the exception is not
intercepted. Cleanup actions specified by [`finally`](../reference/compound_stmts.md#finally) clauses of
[`try`](../reference/compound_stmts.md#try) statements are honored, and it is possible to intercept the
exit attempt at an outer level.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.6: If an error occurs in the cleanup after the Python interpreter
has caught [`SystemExit`](exceptions.md#SystemExit) (such as an error flushing buffered data
in the standard streams), the exit status is changed to 120.

### sys.flags

The [named tuple](../glossary.md#term-named-tuple) *flags* exposes the status of command line
flags.  Flags should only be accessed only by name and not by index.  The
attributes are read only.

| #### flags.debug                  | [`-d`](../using/cmdline.md#cmdoption-d)                                                                                                                            |

| #### flags.no_user_site           | [`-s`](../using/cmdline.md#cmdoption-s)                                                                                                                            |

### sys.float_info

A [named tuple](../glossary.md#term-named-tuple) holding information about the float type. It
contains low level information about the precision and internal
representation.  The values correspond to the various floating-point
constants defined in the standard header file `float.h` for the ‘C’
programming language; see section 5.2.4.2.2 of the 1999 ISO/IEC C standard
[[C99]](#c99), ‘Characteristics of floating types’, for details.

The attribute [`sys.float_info.dig`](#sys.float_info.dig) needs further explanation.  If
`s` is any string representing a decimal number with at most
`sys.float_info.dig` significant digits, then converting `s` to a
float and back again will recover a string representing the same decimal
value:

```python3
>>> import sys
>>> sys.float_info.dig
15
>>> s = '3.14159265358979'    # decimal string with 15 significant digits
>>> format(float(s), '.15g')  # convert to float and back -> same value
'3.14159265358979'
```

But for strings with more than [`sys.float_info.dig`](#sys.float_info.dig) significant digits,
this isn’t always true:

```python3
>>> s = '9876543211234567'    # 16 significant digits is too many!
>>> format(float(s), '.16g')  # conversion changes value
'9876543211234568'
```

### sys.float_repr_style

A string indicating how the [`repr()`](functions.md#repr) function behaves for
floats.  If the string has value `'short'` then for a finite
float `x`, `repr(x)` aims to produce a short string with the
property that `float(repr(x)) == x`.  This is the usual behaviour
in Python 3.1 and later.  Otherwise, `float_repr_style` has value
`'legacy'` and `repr(x)` behaves in the same way as it did in
versions of Python prior to 3.1.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.1.

### sys.getallocatedblocks()

Return the number of memory blocks currently allocated by the interpreter,
regardless of their size.  This function is mainly useful for tracking
and debugging memory leaks.  Because of the interpreter’s internal
caches, the result can vary from call to call; you may have to call
[`_clear_internal_caches()`](#sys._clear_internal_caches) and [`gc.collect()`](gc.md#gc.collect) to get more
predictable results.

If a Python build or implementation cannot reasonably compute this
information, [`getallocatedblocks()`](#sys.getallocatedblocks) is allowed to return 0 instead.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.4.

### sys.getunicodeinternedsize()

Return the number of unicode objects that have been interned.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.12.

### sys.getandroidapilevel()

Return the build-time API level of Android as an integer. This represents the
minimum version of Android this build of Python can run on. For runtime
version information, see [`platform.android_ver()`](platform.md#platform.android_ver).

[Availability](intro.md#availability): Android.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.7.

### sys.getdefaultencoding()

Return `'utf-8'`. This is the name of the default string encoding, used
in methods like [`str.encode()`](stdtypes.md#str.encode).

### sys.getdlopenflags()

Return the current value of the flags that are used for
`dlopen()` calls.  Symbolic names for the flag values can be
found in the [`os`](os.md#module-os) module (`RTLD_*xxx*` constants, e.g.
[`os.RTLD_LAZY`](os.md#os.RTLD_LAZY)).

[Availability](intro.md#availability): Unix.

### sys.getfilesystemencoding()

Get the [filesystem encoding](../glossary.md#term-filesystem-encoding-and-error-handler):
the encoding used with the [filesystem error handler](../glossary.md#term-filesystem-encoding-and-error-handler) to convert between Unicode filenames and bytes
filenames. The filesystem error handler is returned from
[`getfilesystemencodeerrors()`](#sys.getfilesystemencodeerrors).

For best compatibility, str should be used for filenames in all cases,
although representing filenames as bytes is also supported. Functions
accepting or returning filenames should support either str or bytes and
internally convert to the system’s preferred representation.

[`os.fsencode()`](os.md#os.fsencode) and [`os.fsdecode()`](os.md#os.fsdecode) should be used to ensure that
the correct encoding and errors mode are used.

The [filesystem encoding and error handler](../glossary.md#term-filesystem-encoding-and-error-handler) are configured at Python
startup by the [`PyConfig_Read()`](../c-api/init_config.md#c.PyConfig_Read) function: see
[`filesystem_encoding`](../c-api/init_config.md#c.PyConfig.filesystem_encoding) and
[`filesystem_errors`](../c-api/init_config.md#c.PyConfig.filesystem_errors) members of [`PyConfig`](../c-api/init_config.md#c.PyConfig).

Changed in version 3.2: [`getfilesystemencoding()`](#sys.getfilesystemencoding) result cannot be `None` anymore.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.6: Windows is no longer guaranteed to return `'mbcs'`. See [**PEP 529**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0529/)
and [`_enablelegacywindowsfsencoding()`](#sys._enablelegacywindowsfsencoding) for more information.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.7: Return `'utf-8'` if the [Python UTF-8 Mode](os.md#utf8-mode) is
enabled.

### sys.getfilesystemencodeerrors()

Get the [filesystem error handler](../glossary.md#term-filesystem-encoding-and-error-handler): the error handler used with the [filesystem encoding](../glossary.md#term-filesystem-encoding-and-error-handler) to convert between Unicode
filenames and bytes filenames. The filesystem encoding is returned from
[`getfilesystemencoding()`](#sys.getfilesystemencoding).

[`os.fsencode()`](os.md#os.fsencode) and [`os.fsdecode()`](os.md#os.fsdecode) should be used to ensure that
the correct encoding and errors mode are used.

The [filesystem encoding and error handler](../glossary.md#term-filesystem-encoding-and-error-handler) are configured at Python
startup by the [`PyConfig_Read()`](../c-api/init_config.md#c.PyConfig_Read) function: see
[`filesystem_encoding`](../c-api/init_config.md#c.PyConfig.filesystem_encoding) and
[`filesystem_errors`](../c-api/init_config.md#c.PyConfig.filesystem_errors) members of [`PyConfig`](../c-api/init_config.md#c.PyConfig).

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.6.

### sys.get_int_max_str_digits()

Returns the current value for the [integer string conversion length
limitation](stdtypes.md#int-max-str-digits). See also [`set_int_max_str_digits()`](#sys.set_int_max_str_digits).

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.11.

### sys.get_lazy_imports()

Returns the current lazy imports mode as a string.

* `"normal"`: Only imports explicitly marked with the `lazy` keyword
  are lazy
* `"all"`: All top-level imports are potentially lazy
* `"none"`: All lazy imports are suppressed (even explicitly marked
  ones)

See also [`set_lazy_imports()`](#sys.set_lazy_imports) and [**PEP 810**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0810/).

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.15.

### sys.get_lazy_imports_filter()

Returns the current lazy imports filter function, or `None` if no
filter is set.

The filter function is called for every potentially lazy import to
determine whether it should actually be lazy. See
[`set_lazy_imports_filter()`](#sys.set_lazy_imports_filter) for details on the filter function
signature.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.15.

### sys.getrefcount(object)

Return the reference count of the *object*.  The count returned is generally one
higher than you might expect, because it includes the (temporary) reference as
an argument to [`getrefcount()`](#sys.getrefcount).

Note that the returned value may not actually reflect how many
references to the object are actually held.  For example, some
objects are [immortal](../glossary.md#term-immortal) and have a very high refcount that does not
reflect the actual number of references.  Consequently, do not rely
on the returned value to be accurate, other than a value of 0 or 1.

**CPython implementation detail:** [Immortal](../glossary.md#term-immortal) objects with a large reference count can be
identified via [`_is_immortal()`](#sys._is_immortal).

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.12: Immortal objects have very large refcounts that do not match
the actual number of references to the object.

### sys.getrecursionlimit()

Return the current value of the recursion limit, the maximum depth of the Python
interpreter stack.  This limit prevents infinite recursion from causing an
overflow of the C stack and crashing Python.  It can be set by
[`setrecursionlimit()`](#sys.setrecursionlimit).

### sys.getsizeof(object)

Return the size of an object in bytes. The object can be any type of
object. All built-in objects will return correct results, but this
does not have to hold true for third-party extensions as it is implementation
specific.

Only the memory consumption directly attributed to the object is
accounted for, not the memory consumption of objects it refers to.

If given, *default* will be returned if the object does not provide means to
retrieve the size.  Otherwise a [`TypeError`](exceptions.md#TypeError) will be raised.

[`getsizeof()`](#sys.getsizeof) calls the object’s `__sizeof__` method and adds an
additional garbage collector overhead if the object is managed by the garbage
collector.

See [recursive sizeof recipe](https://code.activestate.com/recipes/577504-compute-memory-footprint-of-an-object-and-its-cont/)
for an example of using [`getsizeof()`](#sys.getsizeof) recursively to find the size of
containers and all their contents.

### sys.getswitchinterval()

Return the interpreter’s “thread switch interval” in seconds; see
[`setswitchinterval()`](#sys.setswitchinterval).

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.2.

### sys.\_getframe()

Return a frame object from the call stack.  If optional integer *depth* is
given, return the frame object that many calls below the top of the stack.  If
that is deeper than the call stack, [`ValueError`](exceptions.md#ValueError) is raised.  The default
for *depth* is zero, returning the frame at the top of the call stack.

Raises an [auditing event](#auditing) `sys._getframe` with argument `frame`.

**CPython implementation detail:** This function should be used for internal and specialized purposes only.
It is not guaranteed to exist in all implementations of Python.

### sys.\_getframemodulename()

Return the name of a module from the call stack.  If optional integer *depth*
is given, return the module that many calls below the top of the stack.  If
that is deeper than the call stack, or if the module is unidentifiable,
`None` is returned.  The default for *depth* is zero, returning the
module at the top of the call stack.

Raises an [auditing event](#auditing) `sys._getframemodulename` with argument `depth`.

**CPython implementation detail:** This function should be used for internal and specialized purposes only.
It is not guaranteed to exist in all implementations of Python.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.12.

### sys.getobjects(limit)

This function only exists if CPython was built using the
specialized configure option [`--with-trace-refs`](../using/configure.md#cmdoption-with-trace-refs).
It is intended only for debugging garbage-collection issues.

Return a list of up to *limit* dynamically allocated Python objects.
If *type* is given, only objects of that exact type (not subtypes)
are included.

Objects from the list are not safe to use.
Specifically, the result will include objects from all interpreters that
share their object allocator state (that is, ones created with
[`PyInterpreterConfig.use_main_obmalloc`](../c-api/subinterpreters.md#c.PyInterpreterConfig.use_main_obmalloc) set to 1
or using [`Py_NewInterpreter()`](../c-api/subinterpreters.md#c.Py_NewInterpreter), and the
[main interpreter](../c-api/subinterpreters.md#sub-interpreter-support)).
Mixing objects from different interpreters may lead to crashes
or other unexpected behavior.

**CPython implementation detail:** This function should be used for specialized purposes only.
It is not guaranteed to exist in all implementations of Python.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.14: The result may include objects from other interpreters.

### sys.getprofile()

<a id="index-14"></a>

Get the profiler function as set by [`setprofile()`](#sys.setprofile).

### sys.gettrace()

<a id="index-15"></a>

Get the trace function as set by [`settrace()`](#sys.settrace).

**CPython implementation detail:** The [`gettrace()`](#sys.gettrace) function is intended only for implementing debuggers,
profilers, coverage tools and the like.  Its behavior is part of the
implementation platform, rather than part of the language definition, and
thus may not be available in all Python implementations.

### sys.getwindowsversion()

Return a named tuple describing the Windows version
currently running.  The named elements are *major*, *minor*,
*build*, *platform*, *service_pack*, *service_pack_minor*,
*service_pack_major*, *suite_mask*, *product_type* and
*platform_version*. *service_pack* contains a string,
*platform_version* a 3-tuple and all other values are
integers. The components can also be accessed by name, so
`sys.getwindowsversion()[0]` is equivalent to
`sys.getwindowsversion().major`. For compatibility with prior
versions, only the first 5 elements are retrievable by indexing.

*platform* will be `2` (VER_PLATFORM_WIN32_NT).

*product_type* may be one of the following values:

| Constant                       | Meaning                                                  |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `1` (VER_NT_WORKSTATION)       | The system is a workstation.                             |
| `2` (VER_NT_DOMAIN_CONTROLLER) | The system is a domain<br/>controller.                   |
| `3` (VER_NT_SERVER)            | The system is a server, but not<br/>a domain controller. |

This function wraps the Win32 `GetVersionEx()` function; see the
Microsoft documentation on `OSVERSIONINFOEX()` for more information
about these fields.

*platform_version* returns the major version, minor version and
build number of the current operating system, rather than the version that
is being emulated for the process. It is intended for use in logging rather
than for feature detection.

#### NOTE
*platform_version* derives the version from kernel32.dll which can be of a different
version than the OS version. Please use [`platform`](platform.md#module-platform) module for achieving accurate
OS version.

[Availability](intro.md#availability): Windows.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.2: Changed to a named tuple and added *service_pack_minor*,
*service_pack_major*, *suite_mask*, and *product_type*.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.6: Added *platform_version*

### sys.get_asyncgen_hooks()

Returns an *asyncgen_hooks* object, which is similar to a
[`namedtuple`](collections.md#collections.namedtuple) of the form `(firstiter, finalizer)`,
where *firstiter* and *finalizer* are expected to be either `None` or
functions which take an [asynchronous generator iterator](../glossary.md#term-asynchronous-generator-iterator) as an
argument, and are used to schedule finalization of an asynchronous
generator by an event loop.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.6: See [**PEP 525**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0525/) for more details.

#### NOTE
This function has been added on a provisional basis (see [**PEP 411**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0411/)
for details.)

### sys.get_coroutine_origin_tracking_depth()

Get the current coroutine origin tracking depth, as set by
[`set_coroutine_origin_tracking_depth()`](#sys.set_coroutine_origin_tracking_depth).

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.7.

#### NOTE
This function has been added on a provisional basis (see [**PEP 411**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0411/)
for details.)  Use it only for debugging purposes.

### sys.hash_info

A [named tuple](../glossary.md#term-named-tuple) giving parameters of the numeric hash
implementation.  For more details about hashing of numeric types, see
[Hashing of numeric types](stdtypes.md#numeric-hash).

#### hash_info.width

The width in bits used for hash values

#### hash_info.modulus

The prime modulus P used for numeric hash scheme

#### hash_info.inf

The hash value returned for a positive infinity

#### hash_info.nan

(This attribute is no longer used)

#### hash_info.imag

The multiplier used for the imaginary part of a complex number

#### hash_info.algorithm

The name of the algorithm for hashing of str, bytes, and memoryview

#### hash_info.hash_bits

The internal output size of the hash algorithm

#### hash_info.seed_bits

The size of the seed key of the hash algorithm

#### hash_info.cutoff

Cutoff for small string DJBX33A optimization in range `[1, cutoff)`.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.2.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.4: Added *algorithm*, *hash_bits*, *seed_bits*, and *cutoff*.

### sys.hexversion

The version number encoded as a single integer.  This is guaranteed to increase
with each version, including proper support for non-production releases.  For
example, to test that the Python interpreter is at least version 1.5.2, use:

```python3
if sys.hexversion >= 0x010502F0:
    # use some advanced feature
    ...
else:
    # use an alternative implementation or warn the user
    ...
```

This is called `hexversion` since it only really looks meaningful when viewed
as the result of passing it to the built-in [`hex()`](functions.md#hex) function.  The
[named tuple](../glossary.md#term-named-tuple)  [`sys.version_info`](#sys.version_info) may be used for a more
human-friendly encoding of the same information.

More details of `hexversion` can be found at [API and ABI Versioning](../c-api/apiabiversion.md#apiabiversion).

### sys.implementation

An object containing information about the implementation of the
currently running Python interpreter.  The following attributes are
required to exist in all Python implementations.

*name* is the implementation’s identifier, e.g. `'cpython'`.  The actual
string is defined by the Python implementation, but it is guaranteed to be
lower case.

*version* is a named tuple, in the same format as
[`sys.version_info`](#sys.version_info).  It represents the version of the Python
*implementation*.  This has a distinct meaning from the specific
version of the Python *language* to which the currently running
interpreter conforms, which `sys.version_info` represents.  For
example, for PyPy 1.8 `sys.implementation.version` might be
`sys.version_info(1, 8, 0, 'final', 0)`, whereas `sys.version_info`
would be `sys.version_info(2, 7, 2, 'final', 0)`.  For CPython they
are the same value, since it is the reference implementation.

*hexversion* is the implementation version in hexadecimal format, like
[`sys.hexversion`](#sys.hexversion).

*cache_tag* is the tag used by the import machinery in the filenames of
cached modules.  By convention, it would be a composite of the
implementation’s name and version, like `'cpython-33'`.  However, a
Python implementation may use some other value if appropriate.  If
`cache_tag` is set to `None`, it indicates that module caching should
be disabled.

*supports_isolated_interpreters* is a boolean value, whether
this implementation supports multiple isolated interpreters.
It is `True` for CPython on most platforms.  Platforms with
this support implement the low-level `_interpreters` module.

#### SEE ALSO
[**PEP 684**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0684/), [**PEP 734**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0734/), and [`concurrent.interpreters`](concurrent.interpreters.md#module-concurrent.interpreters).

[`sys.implementation`](#sys.implementation) may contain additional attributes specific to
the Python implementation.  These non-standard attributes must start with
an underscore, and are not described here.  Regardless of its contents,
[`sys.implementation`](#sys.implementation) will not change during a run of the interpreter,
nor between implementation versions.  (It may change between Python
language versions, however.)  See [**PEP 421**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0421/) for more information.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.3.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.14: Added `supports_isolated_interpreters` field.

#### NOTE
The addition of new required attributes must go through the normal PEP
process. See [**PEP 421**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0421/) for more information.

### sys.int_info

A [named tuple](../glossary.md#term-named-tuple) that holds information about Python’s internal
representation of integers.  The attributes are read only.

#### int_info.bits_per_digit

The number of bits held in each digit.
Python integers are stored internally in base `2**int_info.bits_per_digit`.

#### int_info.sizeof_digit

The size in bytes of the C type used to represent a digit.

#### int_info.default_max_str_digits

The default value for [`sys.get_int_max_str_digits()`](#sys.get_int_max_str_digits)
when it is not otherwise explicitly configured.

#### int_info.str_digits_check_threshold

The minimum non-zero value for [`sys.set_int_max_str_digits()`](#sys.set_int_max_str_digits),
[`PYTHONINTMAXSTRDIGITS`](../using/cmdline.md#envvar-PYTHONINTMAXSTRDIGITS), or [`-X int_max_str_digits`](../using/cmdline.md#cmdoption-X).

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.1.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.11: Added [`default_max_str_digits`](#sys.int_info.default_max_str_digits) and
[`str_digits_check_threshold`](#sys.int_info.str_digits_check_threshold).

### sys.\_\_interactivehook_\_

When this attribute exists, its value is automatically called (with no
arguments) when the interpreter is launched in [interactive mode](../tutorial/interpreter.md#tut-interactive).  This is done after the [`PYTHONSTARTUP`](../using/cmdline.md#envvar-PYTHONSTARTUP) file is
read, so that you can set this hook there.  The [`site`](site.md#module-site) module
[sets this](site.md#rlcompleter-config).

Raises an [auditing event](#auditing)
`cpython.run_interactivehook` with the hook object as the argument when
the hook is called on startup.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.4.

### sys.intern(string)

Enter *string* in the table of “interned” strings and return the interned string
– which is *string* itself or a copy. Interning strings is useful to gain a
little performance on dictionary lookup – if the keys in a dictionary are
interned, and the lookup key is interned, the key comparisons (after hashing)
can be done by a pointer compare instead of a string compare.  Normally, the
names used in Python programs are automatically interned, and the dictionaries
used to hold module, class or instance attributes have interned keys.

Interned strings are not [immortal](../glossary.md#term-immortal); you must keep a reference to the
return value of [`intern()`](#sys.intern) around to benefit from it.

### sys.\_is_gil_enabled()

Return [`True`](constants.md#True) if the [GIL](../glossary.md#term-GIL) is enabled and [`False`](constants.md#False) if
it is disabled.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.13.

**CPython implementation detail:** It is not guaranteed to exist in all implementations of Python.

### sys.is_finalizing()

Return [`True`](constants.md#True) if the main Python interpreter is
[shutting down](../glossary.md#term-interpreter-shutdown). Return [`False`](constants.md#False) otherwise.

See also the [`PythonFinalizationError`](exceptions.md#PythonFinalizationError) exception.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.5.

### sys.\_jit

Utilities for observing just-in-time compilation.

**CPython implementation detail:** JIT compilation is an *experimental implementation detail* of CPython.
`sys._jit` is not guaranteed to exist or behave the same way in all
Python implementations, versions, or build configurations.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.14.

#### \_jit.is_available()

Return `True` if the current Python executable supports JIT compilation,
and `False` otherwise.  This can be controlled by building CPython with
the `--experimental-jit` option on Windows, and the
[`--enable-experimental-jit`](../using/configure.md#cmdoption-enable-experimental-jit) option on all other platforms.

#### \_jit.is_enabled()

Return `True` if JIT compilation is enabled for the current Python
process (implies [`sys._jit.is_available()`](#sys._jit.is_available)), and `False` otherwise.
If JIT compilation is available, this can be controlled by setting the
[`PYTHON_JIT`](../using/cmdline.md#envvar-PYTHON_JIT) environment variable to `0` (disabled) or `1`
(enabled) at interpreter startup.

#### \_jit.is_active()

Return `True` if the topmost Python frame is currently executing JIT
code (implies [`sys._jit.is_enabled()`](#sys._jit.is_enabled)), and `False` otherwise.

#### NOTE
This function is intended for testing and debugging the JIT itself.
It should be avoided for any other purpose.

#### NOTE
Due to the nature of tracing JIT compilers, repeated calls to this
function may give surprising results. For example, branching on its
return value will likely lead to unexpected behavior (if doing so
causes JIT code to be entered or exited):

```pycon
>>> for warmup in range(BIG_NUMBER):
...     # This line is "hot", and is eventually JIT-compiled:
...     if sys._jit.is_active():
...         # This line is "cold", and is run in the interpreter:
...         assert sys._jit.is_active()
...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 5, in <module>
    assert sys._jit.is_active()
           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^
AssertionError
```

### sys.last_exc

This variable is not always defined; it is set to the exception instance
when an exception is not handled and the interpreter prints an error message
and a stack traceback.  Its intended use is to allow an interactive user to
import a debugger module and engage in post-mortem debugging without having
to re-execute the command that caused the error.  (Typical use is
`import pdb; pdb.pm()` to enter the post-mortem debugger; see [`pdb`](pdb.md#module-pdb)
module for more information.)

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.12.

### sys.\_is_immortal(op)

Return [`True`](constants.md#True) if the given object is [immortal](../glossary.md#term-immortal), [`False`](constants.md#False)
otherwise.

#### NOTE
Objects that are immortal (and thus return `True` upon being passed
to this function) are not guaranteed to be immortal in future versions,
and vice versa for mortal objects.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.14.

**CPython implementation detail:** This function should be used for specialized purposes only.
It is not guaranteed to exist in all implementations of Python.

### sys.\_is_interned(string)

Return [`True`](constants.md#True) if the given string is “interned”, [`False`](constants.md#False)
otherwise.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.13.

**CPython implementation detail:** It is not guaranteed to exist in all implementations of Python.

### sys.last_type

### sys.last_value

### sys.last_traceback

These three variables are deprecated; use [`sys.last_exc`](#sys.last_exc) instead.
They hold the legacy representation of `sys.last_exc`, as returned
from [`exc_info()`](#sys.exc_info) above.

### sys.maxsize

An integer giving the maximum value a variable of type [`Py_ssize_t`](../c-api/intro.md#c.Py_ssize_t) can
take.  It’s usually `2**31 - 1` on a 32-bit platform and `2**63 - 1` on a
64-bit platform.

### sys.maxunicode

An integer giving the value of the largest Unicode code point,
i.e. `1114111` (`0x10FFFF` in hexadecimal).

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.3: Before [**PEP 393**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0393/), `sys.maxunicode` used to be either `0xFFFF`
or `0x10FFFF`, depending on the configuration option that specified
whether Unicode characters were stored as UCS-2 or UCS-4.

### sys.meta_path

A list of [meta path finder](../glossary.md#term-meta-path-finder) objects that have their
[`find_spec()`](importlib.md#importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec) methods called to see if one
of the objects can find the module to be imported. By default, it holds entries
that implement Python’s default import semantics. The
[`find_spec()`](importlib.md#importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec) method is called with at
least the absolute name of the module being imported. If the module to be
imported is contained in a package, then the parent package’s
[`__path__`](../reference/datamodel.md#module.__path__)
attribute is passed in as a second argument. The method returns a
[module spec](../glossary.md#term-module-spec), or `None` if the module cannot be found.

#### SEE ALSO
[`importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder`](importlib.md#importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder)
: The abstract base class defining the interface of finder objects on
  [`meta_path`](#sys.meta_path).

[`importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec`](importlib.md#importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec)
: The concrete class which
  [`find_spec()`](importlib.md#importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec) should return
  instances of.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.4: [Module specs](../glossary.md#term-module-spec) were introduced in Python 3.4, by
[**PEP 451**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0451/).

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.12: Removed the fallback that looked for a `find_module()` method
if a [`meta_path`](#sys.meta_path) entry didn’t have a
[`find_spec()`](importlib.md#importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder.find_spec) method.

### sys.modules

This is a dictionary that maps module names to modules which have already been
loaded.  This can be manipulated to force reloading of modules and other tricks.
However, replacing the dictionary will not necessarily work as expected and
deleting essential items from the dictionary may cause Python to fail.  If
you want to iterate over this global dictionary always use
`sys.modules.copy()` or `tuple(sys.modules)` to avoid exceptions as its
size may change during iteration as a side effect of code or activity in
other threads.

### sys.orig_argv

The list of the original command line arguments passed to the Python
executable.

The elements of [`sys.orig_argv`](#sys.orig_argv) are the arguments to the Python interpreter,
while the elements of [`sys.argv`](#sys.argv) are the arguments to the user’s program.
Arguments consumed by the interpreter itself will be present in [`sys.orig_argv`](#sys.orig_argv)
and missing from [`sys.argv`](#sys.argv).

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.10.

### sys.path

<a id="index-28"></a>

A list of strings that specifies the search path for modules. Initialized from
the environment variable [`PYTHONPATH`](../using/cmdline.md#envvar-PYTHONPATH), plus an installation-dependent
default.

By default, as initialized upon program startup, a potentially unsafe path
is prepended to [`sys.path`](#sys.path) (*before* the entries inserted as a result
of [`PYTHONPATH`](../using/cmdline.md#envvar-PYTHONPATH)):

* `python -m module` command line: prepend the current working
  directory.
* `python script.py` command line: prepend the script’s directory.
  If it’s a symbolic link, resolve symbolic links.
* `python -c code` and `python` (REPL) command lines: prepend an empty
  string, which means the current working directory.

To not prepend this potentially unsafe path, use the [`-P`](../using/cmdline.md#cmdoption-P) command
line option or the [`PYTHONSAFEPATH`](../using/cmdline.md#envvar-PYTHONSAFEPATH) environment variable.

A program is free to modify this list for its own purposes.  Only strings
should be added to [`sys.path`](#sys.path); all other data types are
ignored during import.

#### SEE ALSO
* Module [`site`](site.md#module-site) This describes how to use .pth files to
  extend [`sys.path`](#sys.path).

### sys.path_hooks

A list of callables that take a path argument to try to create a
[finder](../glossary.md#term-finder) for the path. If a finder can be created, it is to be
returned by the callable, else raise [`ImportError`](exceptions.md#ImportError).

Originally specified in [**PEP 302**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0302/).

### sys.path_importer_cache

A dictionary acting as a cache for [finder](../glossary.md#term-finder) objects. The keys are
paths that have been passed to [`sys.path_hooks`](#sys.path_hooks) and the values are
the finders that are found. If a path is a valid file system path but no
finder is found on [`sys.path_hooks`](#sys.path_hooks) then `None` is
stored.

Originally specified in [**PEP 302**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0302/).

### sys.platform

A string containing a platform identifier. Known values are:

| System         | `platform` value   |
|----------------|--------------------|
| AIX            | `'aix'`            |
| Android        | `'android'`        |
| Emscripten     | `'emscripten'`     |
| FreeBSD        | `'freebsd'`        |
| iOS            | `'ios'`            |
| Linux          | `'linux'`          |
| macOS          | `'darwin'`         |
| Windows        | `'win32'`          |
| Windows/Cygwin | `'cygwin'`         |
| WASI           | `'wasi'`           |

On Unix systems not listed in the table, the value is the lowercased OS name
as returned by `uname -s`, with the first part of the version as returned by
`uname -r` appended, e.g. `'sunos5'`, *at the time when Python was built*.
Unless you want to test for a specific system version, it is therefore
recommended to use the following idiom:

```python3
if sys.platform.startswith('sunos'):
    # SunOS-specific code here...
```

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.3: On Linux, [`sys.platform`](#sys.platform) doesn’t contain the major version anymore.
It is always `'linux'`, instead of `'linux2'` or `'linux3'`.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.8: On AIX, [`sys.platform`](#sys.platform) doesn’t contain the major version anymore.
It is always `'aix'`, instead of `'aix5'` or `'aix7'`.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.13: On Android, [`sys.platform`](#sys.platform) now returns `'android'` rather than
`'linux'`.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.14: On FreeBSD, [`sys.platform`](#sys.platform) doesn’t contain the major version anymore.
It is always `'freebsd'`, instead of `'freebsd13'` or `'freebsd14'`.

#### SEE ALSO
[`os.name`](os.md#os.name) has a coarser granularity.  [`os.uname()`](os.md#os.uname) gives
system-dependent version information.

The [`platform`](platform.md#module-platform) module provides detailed checks for the
system’s identity.

### sys.platlibdir

Name of the platform-specific library directory. It is used to build the
path of standard library and the paths of installed extension modules.

It is equal to `"lib"` on most platforms. On Fedora and SuSE, it is equal
to `"lib64"` on 64-bit platforms which gives the following `sys.path`
paths (where `X.Y` is the Python `major.minor` version):

* `/usr/lib64/pythonX.Y/`:
  Standard library (like `os.py` of the [`os`](os.md#module-os) module)
* `/usr/lib64/pythonX.Y/lib-dynload/`:
  C extension modules of the standard library (like the [`errno`](errno.md#module-errno) module,
  the exact filename is platform specific)
* `/usr/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/` (always use `lib`, not
  [`sys.platlibdir`](#sys.platlibdir)): Third-party modules
* `/usr/lib64/pythonX.Y/site-packages/`:
  C extension modules of third-party packages

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.9.

### sys.prefix

A string giving the site-specific directory prefix where the platform
independent Python files are installed; on Unix, the default is
`/usr/local`. This can be set at build time with the [`--prefix`](../using/configure.md#cmdoption-prefix)
argument to the **configure** script.  See
[Installation paths](sysconfig.md#installation-paths) for derived paths.

#### NOTE
If a [virtual environment](venv.md#venv-def) is in effect, this [`prefix`](#sys.prefix)
will point to the virtual environment. The value for the Python installation
will still be available, via [`base_prefix`](#sys.base_prefix).
Refer to [Virtual Environments](sys_path_init.md#sys-path-init-virtual-environments) for more information.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.14: When running under a [virtual environment](venv.md#venv-def),
[`prefix`](#sys.prefix) and [`exec_prefix`](#sys.exec_prefix) are now set to the virtual
environment prefix by the [path initialization](sys_path_init.md#sys-path-init),
instead of [`site`](site.md#module-site). This means that [`prefix`](#sys.prefix) and
[`exec_prefix`](#sys.exec_prefix) always point to the virtual environment, even when
[`site`](site.md#module-site) is disabled ([`-S`](../using/cmdline.md#cmdoption-S)).

### sys.ps1

### sys.ps2

<a id="index-34"></a>

Strings specifying the primary and secondary prompt of the interpreter.  These
are only defined if the interpreter is in interactive mode.  Their initial
values in this case are `'>>> '` and `'... '`.  If a non-string object is
assigned to either variable, its [`str()`](stdtypes.md#str) is re-evaluated each time the
interpreter prepares to read a new interactive command; this can be used to
implement a dynamic prompt.

### sys.setdlopenflags(n)

Set the flags used by the interpreter for `dlopen()` calls, such as when
the interpreter loads extension modules.  Among other things, this will enable a
lazy resolving of symbols when importing a module, if called as
`sys.setdlopenflags(0)`.  To share symbols across extension modules, call as
`sys.setdlopenflags(os.RTLD_GLOBAL)`.  Symbolic names for the flag values
can be found in the [`os`](os.md#module-os) module (`RTLD_*xxx*` constants, e.g.
[`os.RTLD_LAZY`](os.md#os.RTLD_LAZY)).

[Availability](intro.md#availability): Unix.

### sys.set_int_max_str_digits(maxdigits)

Set the [integer string conversion length limitation](stdtypes.md#int-max-str-digits) used by this interpreter. See also
[`get_int_max_str_digits()`](#sys.get_int_max_str_digits).

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.11.

### sys.set_lazy_imports(mode)

Sets the global lazy imports mode. The *mode* parameter must be one of
the following strings:

* `"normal"`: Only imports explicitly marked with the `lazy` keyword
  are lazy
* `"all"`: All top-level imports become potentially lazy
* `"none"`: All lazy imports are suppressed (even explicitly marked
  ones)

This function is intended for advanced users who need to control lazy
imports across their entire application. Library developers should
generally not use this function as it affects the runtime execution of
applications.

In addition to the mode, lazy imports can be controlled via the filter
provided by [`set_lazy_imports_filter()`](#sys.set_lazy_imports_filter).

See also [`get_lazy_imports()`](#sys.get_lazy_imports) and [**PEP 810**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0810/).

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.15.

### sys.set_lazy_imports_filter(filter)

Sets the lazy imports filter callback. The *filter* parameter must be a
callable or `None` to clear the filter.

The filter function is called for every potentially lazy import to
determine whether it should actually be lazy. It must have the following
signature:

```python3
def filter(importing_module: str, imported_module: str,
           fromlist: tuple[str, ...] | None) -> bool
```

Where:

* *importing_module* is the name of the module doing the import
* *imported_module* is the resolved name of the module being imported
  (for example, `lazy from .spam import eggs` passes
  `package.spam`)
* *fromlist* is the tuple of names being imported (for `from ... import`
  statements), or `None` for regular imports

The filter should return `True` to allow the import to be lazy, or
`False` to force an eager import.

This is an advanced feature intended for specialized users who need
fine-grained control over lazy import behavior.

See also [`get_lazy_imports_filter()`](#sys.get_lazy_imports_filter) and [**PEP 810**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0810/).

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.15.

### sys.setprofile(profilefunc)

<a id="index-37"></a>

Set the system’s profile function, which allows you to implement a Python source
code profiler in Python.  See chapter [profile — Pure Python profiler](profile.md#profile) for more information on the
Python profiler.  The system’s profile function is called similarly to the
system’s trace function (see [`settrace()`](#sys.settrace)), but it is called with different events,
for example it isn’t called for each executed line of code (only on call and return,
but the return event is reported even when an exception has been set). The function is
thread-specific, but there is no way for the profiler to know about context switches between
threads, so it does not make sense to use this in the presence of multiple threads. Also,
its return value is not used, so it can simply return `None`.  Error in the profile
function will cause itself unset.

#### NOTE
The same tracing mechanism is used for `setprofile()` as [`settrace()`](#sys.settrace).
To trace calls with `setprofile()` inside a tracing function
(e.g. in a debugger breakpoint), see [`call_tracing()`](#sys.call_tracing).

Profile functions should have three arguments: *frame*, *event*, and
*arg*. *frame* is the current stack frame.  *event* is a string: `'call'`,
`'return'`, `'c_call'`, `'c_return'`, or `'c_exception'`. *arg* depends
on the event type.

The events have the following meaning:

`'call'`
: A function is called (or some other code block entered).  The
  profile function is called; *arg* is `None`.

`'return'`
: A function (or other code block) is about to return.  The profile
  function is called; *arg* is the value that will be returned, or `None`
  if the event is caused by an exception being raised.

`'c_call'`
: A C function is about to be called.  This may be an extension function or
  a built-in.  *arg* is the C function object.

`'c_return'`
: A C function has returned. *arg* is the C function object.

`'c_exception'`
: A C function has raised an exception.  *arg* is the C function object.

Raises an [auditing event](#auditing) `sys.setprofile` with no arguments.

### sys.setrecursionlimit(limit)

Set the maximum depth of the Python interpreter stack to *limit*.  This limit
prevents infinite recursion from causing an overflow of the C stack and crashing
Python.

The highest possible limit is platform-dependent.  A user may need to set the
limit higher when they have a program that requires deep recursion and a platform
that supports a higher limit.  This should be done with care, because a too-high
limit can lead to a crash.

If the new limit is too low at the current recursion depth, a
[`RecursionError`](exceptions.md#RecursionError) exception is raised.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.5.1: A [`RecursionError`](exceptions.md#RecursionError) exception is now raised if the new limit is too
low at the current recursion depth.

### sys.setswitchinterval(interval)

Set the interpreter’s thread switch interval (in seconds).  This floating-point
value determines the ideal duration of the “timeslices” allocated to
concurrently running Python threads.  Please note that the actual value
can be higher, especially if long-running internal functions or methods
are used.  Also, which thread becomes scheduled at the end of the interval
is the operating system’s decision.  The interpreter doesn’t have its
own scheduler.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.2.

### sys.settrace(tracefunc)

<a id="index-38"></a>

Set the system’s trace function, which allows you to implement a Python
source code debugger in Python.  The function is thread-specific; for a
debugger to support multiple threads, it must register a trace function using
[`settrace()`](#sys.settrace) for each thread being debugged or use [`threading.settrace()`](threading.md#threading.settrace).

Trace functions should have three arguments: *frame*, *event*, and
*arg*. *frame* is the [current stack frame](../reference/datamodel.md#frame-objects). *event* is a string: `'call'`,
`'line'`, `'return'`, `'exception'` or `'opcode'`.  *arg* depends on
the event type.

The trace function is invoked (with *event* set to `'call'`) whenever a new
local scope is entered; it should return a reference to a local trace
function to be used for the new scope, or `None` if the scope shouldn’t be
traced.

The local trace function should return a reference to itself, or to another
function which would then be used as the local trace function for the scope.

If there is any error occurred in the trace function, it will be unset, just
like `settrace(None)` is called.

#### NOTE
Tracing is disabled while calling the trace function (e.g. a function set by
`settrace()`). For recursive tracing see [`call_tracing()`](#sys.call_tracing).

The events have the following meaning:

`'call'`
: A function is called (or some other code block entered).  The
  global trace function is called; *arg* is `None`; the return value
  specifies the local trace function.

`'line'`
: The interpreter is about to execute a new line of code or re-execute the
  condition of a loop.  The local trace function is called; *arg* is
  `None`; the return value specifies the new local trace function.  See
  `Objects/lnotab_notes.txt` for a detailed explanation of how this
  works.
  Per-line events may be disabled for a frame by setting
  [`f_trace_lines`](../reference/datamodel.md#frame.f_trace_lines) to [`False`](constants.md#False) on that
  [frame](../reference/datamodel.md#frame-objects).

`'return'`
: A function (or other code block) is about to return.  The local trace
  function is called; *arg* is the value that will be returned, or `None`
  if the event is caused by an exception being raised.  The trace function’s
  return value is ignored.

`'exception'`
: An exception has occurred.  The local trace function is called; *arg* is a
  tuple `(exception, value, traceback)`; the return value specifies the
  new local trace function.

`'opcode'`
: The interpreter is about to execute a new opcode (see [`dis`](dis.md#module-dis) for
  opcode details).  The local trace function is called; *arg* is
  `None`; the return value specifies the new local trace function.
  Per-opcode events are not emitted by default: they must be explicitly
  requested by setting [`f_trace_opcodes`](../reference/datamodel.md#frame.f_trace_opcodes) to [`True`](constants.md#True) on the
  [frame](../reference/datamodel.md#frame-objects).

Note that as an exception is propagated down the chain of callers, an
`'exception'` event is generated at each level.

For more fine-grained usage, it’s possible to set a trace function by
assigning `frame.f_trace = tracefunc` explicitly, rather than relying on
it being set indirectly via the return value from an already installed
trace function. This is also required for activating the trace function on
the current frame, which [`settrace()`](#sys.settrace) doesn’t do. Note that in order
for this to work, a global tracing function must have been installed
with [`settrace()`](#sys.settrace) in order to enable the runtime tracing machinery,
but it doesn’t need to be the same tracing function (e.g. it could be a
low overhead tracing function that simply returns `None` to disable
itself immediately on each frame).

For more information on code and frame objects, refer to [The standard type hierarchy](../reference/datamodel.md#types).

Raises an [auditing event](#auditing) `sys.settrace` with no arguments.

**CPython implementation detail:** The [`settrace()`](#sys.settrace) function is intended only for implementing debuggers,
profilers, coverage tools and the like.  Its behavior is part of the
implementation platform, rather than part of the language definition, and
thus may not be available in all Python implementations.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.7: `'opcode'` event type added; [`f_trace_lines`](../reference/datamodel.md#frame.f_trace_lines) and
[`f_trace_opcodes`](../reference/datamodel.md#frame.f_trace_opcodes) attributes added to frames

### sys.set_asyncgen_hooks([firstiter] [, finalizer])

Accepts two optional keyword arguments which are callables that accept an
[asynchronous generator iterator](../glossary.md#term-asynchronous-generator-iterator) as an argument. The *firstiter*
callable will be called when an asynchronous generator is iterated for the
first time. The *finalizer* will be called when an asynchronous generator
is about to be garbage collected.

Raises an [auditing event](#auditing) `sys.set_asyncgen_hooks_firstiter` with no arguments.

Raises an [auditing event](#auditing) `sys.set_asyncgen_hooks_finalizer` with no arguments.

Two auditing events are raised because the underlying API consists of two
calls, each of which must raise its own event.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.6: See [**PEP 525**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0525/) for more details, and for a reference example of a
*finalizer* method see the implementation of
`asyncio.Loop.shutdown_asyncgens` in
[Lib/asyncio/base_events.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/main/Lib/asyncio/base_events.py)

#### NOTE
This function has been added on a provisional basis (see [**PEP 411**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0411/)
for details.)

### sys.set_coroutine_origin_tracking_depth(depth)

Allows enabling or disabling coroutine origin tracking. When
enabled, the `cr_origin` attribute on coroutine objects will
contain a tuple of (filename, line number, function name) tuples
describing the traceback where the coroutine object was created,
with the most recent call first. When disabled, `cr_origin` will
be `None`.

To enable, pass a *depth* value greater than zero; this sets the
number of frames whose information will be captured. To disable,
set *depth* to zero.

This setting is thread-specific.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.7.

#### NOTE
This function has been added on a provisional basis (see [**PEP 411**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0411/)
for details.)  Use it only for debugging purposes.

### sys.activate_stack_trampoline(backend,)

Activate the stack profiler trampoline *backend*.
The only supported backend is `"perf"`.

Stack trampolines cannot be activated if the JIT is active.

[Availability](intro.md#availability): Linux.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.12.

#### SEE ALSO
* [Python support for the perf map compatible profilers](../howto/perf_profiling.md#perf-profiling)
* [https://perf.wiki.kernel.org](https://perf.wiki.kernel.org)

### sys.deactivate_stack_trampoline()

Deactivate the current stack profiler trampoline backend.

If no stack profiler is activated, this function has no effect.

[Availability](intro.md#availability): Linux.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.12.

### sys.is_stack_trampoline_active()

Return `True` if a stack profiler trampoline is active.

[Availability](intro.md#availability): Linux.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.12.

### sys.remote_exec(pid, script)

Executes *script*, a file containing Python code in the remote
process with the given *pid*.

This function returns immediately, and the code will be executed by the
target process’s main thread at the next available opportunity, similarly
to how signals are handled. There is no interface to determine when the
code has been executed. The caller is responsible for making sure that
the file still exists whenever the remote process tries to read it and that
it hasn’t been overwritten.

The remote process must be running a CPython interpreter of the same major
and minor version as the local process. If either the local or remote
interpreter is pre-release (alpha, beta, or release candidate) then the
local and remote interpreters must be the same exact version.

See [Remote debugging attachment protocol](../howto/remote_debugging.md#remote-debugging) for more information about the remote debugging
mechanism.

When the code is executed in the remote process, an
[auditing event](#auditing) `sys.remote_exec` is raised with
the *pid* and the path to the script file.
This event is raised in the process that called [`sys.remote_exec()`](#sys.remote_exec).

When the script is executed in the remote process, an
[auditing event](#auditing)
`cpython.remote_debugger_script` is raised
with the path in the remote process.
This event is raised in the remote process, not the one
that called [`sys.remote_exec()`](#sys.remote_exec).

[Availability](intro.md#availability): Unix, Windows.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.14: See [**PEP 768**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0768/) for more details.

### sys.\_enablelegacywindowsfsencoding()

Changes the [filesystem encoding and error handler](../glossary.md#term-filesystem-encoding-and-error-handler) to ‘mbcs’ and
‘replace’ respectively, for consistency with versions of Python prior to
3.6.

This is equivalent to defining the [`PYTHONLEGACYWINDOWSFSENCODING`](../using/cmdline.md#envvar-PYTHONLEGACYWINDOWSFSENCODING)
environment variable before launching Python.

See also [`sys.getfilesystemencoding()`](#sys.getfilesystemencoding) and
[`sys.getfilesystemencodeerrors()`](#sys.getfilesystemencodeerrors).

[Availability](intro.md#availability): Windows.

#### NOTE
Changing the filesystem encoding after Python startup is risky because
the old fsencoding or paths encoded by the old fsencoding may be cached
somewhere. Use [`PYTHONLEGACYWINDOWSFSENCODING`](../using/cmdline.md#envvar-PYTHONLEGACYWINDOWSFSENCODING) instead.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.6: See [**PEP 529**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0529/) for more details.

#### Deprecated-removed
Deprecated since version 3.13, will be removed in version 3.16: Use [`PYTHONLEGACYWINDOWSFSENCODING`](../using/cmdline.md#envvar-PYTHONLEGACYWINDOWSFSENCODING) instead.

### sys.stdin

### sys.stdout

### sys.stderr

[File objects](../glossary.md#term-file-object) used by the interpreter for standard
input, output and errors:

* `stdin` is used for all interactive input (including calls to
  [`input()`](functions.md#input));
* `stdout` is used for the output of [`print()`](functions.md#print) and [expression](../glossary.md#term-expression)
  statements and for the prompts of [`input()`](functions.md#input);
* The interpreter’s own prompts and its error messages go to `stderr`.

These streams are regular [text files](../glossary.md#term-text-file) like those
returned by the [`open()`](functions.md#open) function.  Their parameters are chosen as
follows:

* The encoding and error handling are is initialized from
  [`PyConfig.stdio_encoding`](../c-api/init_config.md#c.PyConfig.stdio_encoding) and [`PyConfig.stdio_errors`](../c-api/init_config.md#c.PyConfig.stdio_errors).

  On Windows, UTF-8 is used for the console device.  Non-character
  devices such as disk files and pipes use the system locale
  encoding (i.e. the ANSI codepage).  Non-console character
  devices such as NUL (i.e. where `isatty()` returns `True`) use the
  value of the console input and output codepages at startup,
  respectively for stdin and stdout/stderr. This defaults to the
  system [locale encoding](../glossary.md#term-locale-encoding) if the process is not initially attached
  to a console.

  The special behaviour of the console can be overridden
  by setting the environment variable PYTHONLEGACYWINDOWSSTDIO
  before starting Python. In that case, the console codepages are
  used as for any other character device.

  Under all platforms, you can override the character encoding by
  setting the [`PYTHONIOENCODING`](../using/cmdline.md#envvar-PYTHONIOENCODING) environment variable before
  starting Python or by using the new [`-X`](../using/cmdline.md#cmdoption-X) `utf8` command
  line option and [`PYTHONUTF8`](../using/cmdline.md#envvar-PYTHONUTF8) environment variable.  However,
  for the Windows console, this only applies when
  [`PYTHONLEGACYWINDOWSSTDIO`](../using/cmdline.md#envvar-PYTHONLEGACYWINDOWSSTDIO) is also set.
* When interactive, the `stdout` stream is line-buffered. Otherwise,
  it is block-buffered like regular text files.  The `stderr` stream
  is line-buffered in both cases.  You can make both streams unbuffered
  by passing the [`-u`](../using/cmdline.md#cmdoption-u) command-line option or setting the
  [`PYTHONUNBUFFERED`](../using/cmdline.md#envvar-PYTHONUNBUFFERED) environment variable.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.9: Non-interactive `stderr` is now line-buffered instead of fully
buffered.

#### NOTE
To write or read binary data from/to the standard streams, use the
underlying binary [`buffer`](io.md#io.TextIOBase.buffer) object.  For example, to
write bytes to [`stdout`](#sys.stdout), use `sys.stdout.buffer.write(b'abc')`.

However, if you are writing a library (and do not control in which
context its code will be executed), be aware that the standard streams
may be replaced with file-like objects like [`io.StringIO`](io.md#io.StringIO) which
do not support the `buffer` attribute.

### sys.\_\_stdin_\_

### sys.\_\_stdout_\_

### sys.\_\_stderr_\_

These objects contain the original values of `stdin`, `stderr` and
`stdout` at the start of the program.  They are used during finalization,
and could be useful to print to the actual standard stream no matter if the
`sys.std*` object has been redirected.

It can also be used to restore the actual files to known working file objects
in case they have been overwritten with a broken object.  However, the
preferred way to do this is to explicitly save the previous stream before
replacing it, and restore the saved object.

#### NOTE
Under some conditions `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr` as well as the
original values `__stdin__`, `__stdout__` and `__stderr__` can be
`None`. It is usually the case for Windows GUI apps that aren’t connected
to a console and Python apps started with **pythonw**.

### sys.stdlib_module_names

A frozenset of strings containing the names of standard library modules.

It is the same on all platforms. Modules which are not available on
some platforms and modules disabled at Python build are also listed.
All module kinds are listed: pure Python, built-in, frozen and extension
modules. Test modules are excluded.

For packages, only the main package is listed: sub-packages and sub-modules
are not listed. For example, the `email` package is listed, but the
`email.mime` sub-package and the `email.message` sub-module are not
listed.

See also the [`sys.builtin_module_names`](#sys.builtin_module_names) list.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.10.

### sys.thread_info

A [named tuple](../glossary.md#term-named-tuple) holding information about the thread
implementation.

#### thread_info.name

The name of the thread implementation:

* `"nt"`: Windows threads
* `"pthread"`: POSIX threads
* `"pthread-stubs"`: stub POSIX threads
  (on WebAssembly platforms without threading support)
* `"solaris"`: Solaris threads

#### thread_info.lock

The name of the lock implementation:

* `"semaphore"`: a lock uses a semaphore
* `"mutex+cond"`: a lock uses a mutex and a condition variable
* `None` if this information is unknown

#### thread_info.version

The name and version of the thread library.
It is a string, or `None` if this information is unknown.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.3.

### sys.tracebacklimit

When this variable is set to an integer value, it determines the maximum number
of levels of traceback information printed when an unhandled exception occurs.
The default is `1000`.  When set to `0` or less, all traceback information
is suppressed and only the exception type and value are printed.

### sys.unraisablehook(unraisable,)

Handle an unraisable exception.

Called when an exception has occurred but there is no way for Python to
handle it. For example, when a destructor raises an exception or during
garbage collection ([`gc.collect()`](gc.md#gc.collect)).

The *unraisable* argument has the following attributes:

* `exc_type`: Exception type.
* `exc_value`: Exception value, can be `None`.
* `exc_traceback`: Exception traceback, can be `None`.
* `err_msg`: Error message, can be `None`.
* `object`: Object causing the exception, can be `None`.

The default hook formats `err_msg` and `object` as:
`f'{err_msg}: {object!r}'`; use “Exception ignored in” error message
if `err_msg` is `None`. Similar to the [`traceback`](traceback.md#module-traceback) module,
this adds color to exceptions by default. This can be disabled using
[environment variables](../using/cmdline.md#using-on-controlling-color).

[`sys.unraisablehook()`](#sys.unraisablehook) can be overridden to control how unraisable
exceptions are handled.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.15: Exceptions are now printed with colorful text.

#### SEE ALSO
[`excepthook()`](#sys.excepthook) which handles uncaught exceptions.

#### WARNING
Storing `exc_value` using a custom hook can create a reference cycle.
It should be cleared explicitly to break the reference cycle when the
exception is no longer needed.

Storing `object` using a custom hook can resurrect it if it is set to an
object which is being finalized. Avoid storing `object` after the custom
hook completes to avoid resurrecting objects.

Raise an auditing event `sys.unraisablehook` with arguments
*hook*, *unraisable* when an exception that cannot be handled occurs.
The *unraisable* object is the same as what will be passed to the hook.
If no hook has been set, *hook* may be `None`.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.8.

### sys.version

A string containing the version number of the Python interpreter plus additional
information on the build number and compiler used.  This string is displayed
when the interactive interpreter is started.  Do not extract version information
out of it, rather, use [`version_info`](#sys.version_info) and the functions provided by the
[`platform`](platform.md#module-platform) module.

### sys.api_version

The C API version, equivalent to the C macro [`PYTHON_API_VERSION`](../c-api/module.md#c.PYTHON_API_VERSION).
Defined for backwards compatibility.

Currently, this constant is not updated in new Python versions, and is not
useful for versioning. This may change in the future.

### sys.version_info

A tuple containing the five components of the version number: *major*, *minor*,
*micro*, *releaselevel*, and *serial*.  All values except *releaselevel* are
integers; the release level is `'alpha'`, `'beta'`, `'candidate'`, or
`'final'`.  The `version_info` value corresponding to the Python version 2.0
is `(2, 0, 0, 'final', 0)`.  The components can also be accessed by name,
so `sys.version_info[0]` is equivalent to `sys.version_info.major`
and so on.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.1: Added named component attributes.

### sys.warnoptions

This is an implementation detail of the warnings framework; do not modify this
value.  Refer to the [`warnings`](warnings.md#module-warnings) module for more information on the warnings
framework.

### sys.winver

The version number used to form registry keys on Windows platforms. This is
stored as string resource 1000 in the Python DLL.  The value is normally the
major and minor versions of the running Python interpreter.  It is provided in the `sys`
module for informational purposes; modifying this value has no effect on the
registry keys used by Python.

[Availability](intro.md#availability): Windows.

### sys.monitoring

Namespace containing functions and constants for register callbacks
and controlling monitoring events.
See  [`sys.monitoring`](sys.monitoring.md#module-sys.monitoring) for details.

### sys.\_xoptions

A dictionary of the various implementation-specific flags passed through
the [`-X`](../using/cmdline.md#cmdoption-X) command-line option.  Option names are either mapped to
their values, if given explicitly, or to [`True`](constants.md#True).  Example:

```shell-session
$ ./python -Xa=b -Xc
Python 3.2a3+ (py3k, Oct 16 2010, 20:14:50)
[GCC 4.4.3] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import sys
>>> sys._xoptions
{'a': 'b', 'c': True}
```

**CPython implementation detail:** This is a CPython-specific way of accessing options passed through
[`-X`](../using/cmdline.md#cmdoption-X).  Other implementations may export them through other
means, or not at all.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.2.
