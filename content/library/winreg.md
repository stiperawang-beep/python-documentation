# `winreg` — Windows registry access

**Source code:** [PC/winreg.c](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/main/PC/winreg.c)

---

These functions expose the Windows registry API to Python.  Instead of using an
integer as the registry handle, a [handle object](#handle-object) is used
to ensure that the handles are closed correctly, even if the programmer neglects
to explicitly close them.

[Availability](intro.md#availability): Windows.

<a id="exception-changed"></a>

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.3: Several functions in this module used to raise a
[`WindowsError`](exceptions.md#WindowsError), which is now an alias of [`OSError`](exceptions.md#OSError).

<a id="functions"></a>

## Functions

This module offers the following functions:

### winreg.CloseKey(hkey)

Closes a previously opened registry key.  The *hkey* argument specifies a
previously opened key.

#### NOTE
If *hkey* is not closed using this method (or via [`hkey.Close()`](#winreg.PyHKEY.Close)), it is closed when the *hkey* object is destroyed by
Python.

### winreg.ConnectRegistry(computer_name, key)

Establishes a connection to a predefined registry handle on another computer,
and returns a [handle object](#handle-object).

*computer_name* is the name of the remote computer, of the form
`r"\\computername"`.  If `None`, the local computer is used.

*key* is the predefined handle to connect to.

The return value is the handle of the opened key. If the function fails, an
[`OSError`](exceptions.md#OSError) exception is raised.

Raises an [auditing event](sys.md#auditing) `winreg.ConnectRegistry` with arguments `computer_name`, `key`.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.3: See [above](#exception-changed).

### winreg.CreateKey(key, sub_key)

Creates or opens the specified key, returning a
[handle object](#handle-object).

*key* is an already open key, or one of the predefined
[HKEY_\* constants](#hkey-constants).

*sub_key* is a string that names the key this method opens or creates.

If *key* is one of the predefined keys, *sub_key* may be `None`. In that
case, the handle returned is the same key handle passed in to the function.

If the key already exists, this function opens the existing key.

The return value is the handle of the opened key. If the function fails, an
[`OSError`](exceptions.md#OSError) exception is raised.

Raises an [auditing event](sys.md#auditing) `winreg.CreateKey` with arguments `key`, `sub_key`, `access`.

Raises an [auditing event](sys.md#auditing) `winreg.OpenKey/result` with argument `key`.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.3: See [above](#exception-changed).

### winreg.CreateKeyEx(key, sub_key, reserved=0, access=KEY_WRITE)

Creates or opens the specified key, returning a
[handle object](#handle-object).

*key* is an already open key, or one of the predefined
[HKEY_\* constants](#hkey-constants).

*sub_key* is a string that names the key this method opens or creates.

*reserved* is a reserved integer, and must be zero. The default is zero.

*access* is an integer that specifies an access mask that describes the desired
security access for the key.  Default is [`KEY_WRITE`](#winreg.KEY_WRITE).  See
[Access Rights](#access-rights) for other allowed values.

If *key* is one of the predefined keys, *sub_key* may be `None`. In that
case, the handle returned is the same key handle passed in to the function.

If the key already exists, this function opens the existing key.

The return value is the handle of the opened key. If the function fails, an
[`OSError`](exceptions.md#OSError) exception is raised.

Raises an [auditing event](sys.md#auditing) `winreg.CreateKey` with arguments `key`, `sub_key`, `access`.

Raises an [auditing event](sys.md#auditing) `winreg.OpenKey/result` with argument `key`.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.2.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.3: See [above](#exception-changed).

### winreg.DeleteKey(key, sub_key)

Deletes the specified key.

*key* is an already open key, or one of the predefined
[HKEY_\* constants](#hkey-constants).

*sub_key* is a string that must be a subkey of the key identified by the *key*
parameter.  This value must not be `None`, and the key may not have subkeys.

*This method can not delete keys with subkeys.*

If the method succeeds, the entire key, including all of its values, is removed.
If the method fails, an [`OSError`](exceptions.md#OSError) exception is raised.

Raises an [auditing event](sys.md#auditing) `winreg.DeleteKey` with arguments `key`, `sub_key`, `access`.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.3: See [above](#exception-changed).

### winreg.DeleteKeyEx(key, sub_key, access=KEY_WOW64_64KEY, reserved=0)

*key* is an already open key, or one of the predefined
[HKEY_\* constants](#hkey-constants).

*sub_key* is a string that must be a subkey of the key identified by the
*key* parameter. This value must not be `None`, and the key may not have
subkeys.

*reserved* is a reserved integer, and must be zero. The default is zero.

*access* is an integer that specifies an access mask that describes the
desired security access for the key.  Default is [`KEY_WOW64_64KEY`](#winreg.KEY_WOW64_64KEY).
On 32-bit Windows, the WOW64 constants are ignored.
See [Access Rights](#access-rights) for other allowed values.

*This method can not delete keys with subkeys.*

If the method succeeds, the entire key, including all of its values, is
removed. If the method fails, an [`OSError`](exceptions.md#OSError) exception is raised.

On unsupported Windows versions, [`NotImplementedError`](exceptions.md#NotImplementedError) is raised.

Deletes the specified key and all its subkeys and values recursively.

*key* is an already open key, or one of the predefined
[HKEY_\* constants](#hkey-constants).

*sub_key* is a string that names the subkey to delete. If `None`,
deletes all subkeys and values of the specified key.

This function deletes a key and all its descendants. If *sub_key* is
`None`, all subkeys and values of the specified key are deleted.

Raises an [auditing event](sys.md#auditing) `winreg.DeleteTree` with arguments `key`, `sub_key`.

#### Versionadded

Raises an [auditing event](sys.md#auditing) `winreg.DeleteValue` with arguments `key`, `value`.

### winreg.EnumKey(key, index)

Enumerates subkeys of an open registry key, returning a string.

*key* is an already open key, or one of the predefined
[HKEY_\* constants](#hkey-constants).

*index* is an integer that identifies the index of the key to retrieve.

The function retrieves the name of one subkey each time it is called.  It is
typically called repeatedly until an [`OSError`](exceptions.md#OSError) exception is
raised, indicating, no more values are available.

Raises an [auditing event](sys.md#auditing) `winreg.EnumKey` with arguments `key`, `index`.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.3: See [above](#exception-changed).

### winreg.EnumValue(key, index)

Enumerates values of an open registry key, returning a tuple.

*key* is an already open key, or one of the predefined
[HKEY_\* constants](#hkey-constants).

*index* is an integer that identifies the index of the value to retrieve.

The function retrieves the name of one subkey each time it is called. It is
typically called repeatedly, until an [`OSError`](exceptions.md#OSError) exception is
raised, indicating no more values.

The result is a tuple of 3 items:

| Index   | Meaning                                                                                                                    |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0`     | A string that identifies the value name                                                                                    |
| `1`     | An object that holds the value data, and<br/>whose type depends on the underlying<br/>registry type                        |
| `2`     | An integer that identifies the type of the<br/>value data (see table in docs for<br/>[`SetValueEx()`](#winreg.SetValueEx)) |

Raises an [auditing event](sys.md#auditing) `winreg.EnumValue` with arguments `key`, `index`.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.3: See [above](#exception-changed).

<a id="index-0"></a>

### winreg.ExpandEnvironmentStrings(str)

Expands environment variable placeholders `%NAME%` in strings like
[`REG_EXPAND_SZ`](#winreg.REG_EXPAND_SZ):

```python3
>>> ExpandEnvironmentStrings('%windir%')
'C:\\Windows'
```

Raises an [auditing event](sys.md#auditing) `winreg.ExpandEnvironmentStrings` with argument `str`.

### winreg.FlushKey(key)

Writes all the attributes of a key to the registry.

*key* is an already open key, or one of the predefined
[HKEY_\* constants](#hkey-constants).

It is not necessary to call [`FlushKey()`](#winreg.FlushKey) to change a key. Registry changes are
flushed to disk by the registry using its lazy flusher.  Registry changes are
also flushed to disk at system shutdown.  Unlike [`CloseKey()`](#winreg.CloseKey), the
[`FlushKey()`](#winreg.FlushKey) method returns only when all the data has been written to the
registry. An application should only call [`FlushKey()`](#winreg.FlushKey) if it requires
absolute certainty that registry changes are on disk.

#### NOTE
If you don’t know whether a [`FlushKey()`](#winreg.FlushKey) call is required, it probably
isn’t.

### winreg.LoadKey(key, sub_key, file_name)

Creates a subkey under the specified key and stores registration information
from a specified file into that subkey.

*key* is a handle returned by [`ConnectRegistry()`](#winreg.ConnectRegistry) or one of the constants
[`HKEY_USERS`](#winreg.HKEY_USERS) or [`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`](#winreg.HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE).

*sub_key* is a string that identifies the subkey to load.

*file_name* is the name of the file to load registry data from. This file must
have been created with the [`SaveKey()`](#winreg.SaveKey) function. Under the file allocation
table (FAT) file system, the filename may not have an extension.

A call to [`LoadKey()`](#winreg.LoadKey) fails if the calling process does not have the
`SE_RESTORE_PRIVILEGE` privilege.  Note that privileges are different
from permissions – see the [RegLoadKey documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms724889%28v=VS.85%29.aspx) for
more details.

If *key* is a handle returned by [`ConnectRegistry()`](#winreg.ConnectRegistry), then the path
specified in *file_name* is relative to the remote computer.

Raises an [auditing event](sys.md#auditing) `winreg.LoadKey` with arguments `key`, `sub_key`, `file_name`.

### winreg.OpenKey(key, sub_key, reserved=0, access=KEY_READ)

### winreg.OpenKeyEx(key, sub_key, reserved=0, access=KEY_READ)

Opens the specified key, returning a [handle object](#handle-object).

*key* is an already open key, or one of the predefined
[HKEY_\* constants](#hkey-constants).

*sub_key* is a string that identifies the sub_key to open.

*reserved* is a reserved integer, and must be zero.  The default is zero.

*access* is an integer that specifies an access mask that describes the desired
security access for the key.  Default is [`KEY_READ`](#winreg.KEY_READ).  See [Access
Rights](#access-rights) for other allowed values.

The result is a new handle to the specified key.

If the function fails, [`OSError`](exceptions.md#OSError) is raised.

Raises an [auditing event](sys.md#auditing) `winreg.OpenKey` with arguments `key`, `sub_key`, `access`.

Raises an [auditing event](sys.md#auditing) `winreg.OpenKey/result` with argument `key`.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.2: Allow the use of named arguments.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.3: See [above](#exception-changed).

### winreg.QueryInfoKey(key)

Returns information about a key, as a tuple.

*key* is an already open key, or one of the predefined
[HKEY_\* constants](#hkey-constants).

The result is a tuple of 3 items:

| Index   | Meaning                                                                                                            |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0`     | An integer giving the number of sub keys<br/>this key has.                                                         |
| `1`     | An integer giving the number of values this<br/>key has.                                                           |
| `2`     | An integer giving when the key was last<br/>modified (if available) as 100’s of<br/>nanoseconds since Jan 1, 1601. |

Raises an [auditing event](sys.md#auditing) `winreg.QueryInfoKey` with argument `key`.

### winreg.QueryValue(key, sub_key)

Retrieves the unnamed value for a key, as a string.

*key* is an already open key, or one of the predefined
[HKEY_\* constants](#hkey-constants).

*sub_key* is a string that holds the name of the subkey with which the value is
associated.  If this parameter is `None` or empty, the function retrieves the
value set by the [`SetValue()`](#winreg.SetValue) method for the key identified by *key*.

Values in the registry have name, type, and data components. This method
retrieves the data for a key’s first value that has a `NULL` name. But the
underlying API call doesn’t return the type, so always use
[`QueryValueEx()`](#winreg.QueryValueEx) if possible.

Raises an [auditing event](sys.md#auditing) `winreg.QueryValue` with arguments `key`, `sub_key`, `value_name`.

### winreg.QueryValueEx(key, value_name)

Retrieves the type and data for a specified value name associated with
an open registry key.

*key* is an already open key, or one of the predefined
[HKEY_\* constants](#hkey-constants).

*value_name* is a string indicating the value to query.

The result is a tuple of 2 items:

| Index   | Meaning                                                                                                                 |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0`     | The value of the registry item.                                                                                         |
| `1`     | An integer giving the registry type for<br/>this value (see table in docs for<br/>[`SetValueEx()`](#winreg.SetValueEx)) |

Raises an [auditing event](sys.md#auditing) `winreg.QueryValue` with arguments `key`, `sub_key`, `value_name`.

### winreg.SaveKey(key, file_name)

Saves the specified key, and all its subkeys to the specified file.

*key* is an already open key, or one of the predefined
[HKEY_\* constants](#hkey-constants).

*file_name* is the name of the file to save registry data to.  This file
cannot already exist. If this filename includes an extension, it cannot be
used on file allocation table (FAT) file systems by the [`LoadKey()`](#winreg.LoadKey)
method.

If *key* represents a key on a remote computer, the path described by
*file_name* is relative to the remote computer. The caller of this method must
possess the **SeBackupPrivilege** security privilege.  Note that
privileges are different than permissions – see the
[Conflicts Between User Rights and Permissions documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms724878%28v=VS.85%29.aspx)
for more details.

This function passes `NULL` for *security_attributes* to the API.

Raises an [auditing event](sys.md#auditing) `winreg.SaveKey` with arguments `key`, `file_name`.

### winreg.SetValue(key, sub_key, type, value)

Associates a value with a specified key.

*key* is an already open key, or one of the predefined
[HKEY_\* constants](#hkey-constants).

*sub_key* is a string that names the subkey with which the value is associated.

*type* is an integer that specifies the type of the data. Currently this must be
[`REG_SZ`](#winreg.REG_SZ), meaning only strings are supported.  Use the [`SetValueEx()`](#winreg.SetValueEx)
function for support for other data types.

*value* is a string that specifies the new value.

If the key specified by the *sub_key* parameter does not exist, the SetValue
function creates it.

Value lengths are limited by available memory. Long values (more than 2048
bytes) should be stored as files with the filenames stored in the configuration
registry.  This helps the registry perform efficiently.

The key identified by the *key* parameter must have been opened with
[`KEY_SET_VALUE`](#winreg.KEY_SET_VALUE) access.

Raises an [auditing event](sys.md#auditing) `winreg.SetValue` with arguments `key`, `sub_key`, `type`, `value`.

### winreg.SetValueEx(key, value_name, reserved, type, value)

Stores data in the value field of an open registry key.

*key* is an already open key, or one of the predefined
[HKEY_\* constants](#hkey-constants).

*value_name* is a string that names the subkey with which the value is
associated.

*reserved* can be anything – zero is always passed to the API.

*type* is an integer that specifies the type of the data. See
[Value Types](#value-types) for the available types.

*value* is a string that specifies the new value.

This method can also set additional value and type information for the specified
key.  The key identified by the key parameter must have been opened with
[`KEY_SET_VALUE`](#winreg.KEY_SET_VALUE) access.

To open the key, use the [`CreateKey()`](#winreg.CreateKey) or [`OpenKey()`](#winreg.OpenKey) methods.

Value lengths are limited by available memory. Long values (more than 2048
bytes) should be stored as files with the filenames stored in the configuration
registry.  This helps the registry perform efficiently.

Raises an [auditing event](sys.md#auditing) `winreg.SetValue` with arguments `key`, `sub_key`, `type`, `value`.

### winreg.DisableReflectionKey(key)

Disables registry reflection for 32-bit processes running on a 64-bit
operating system.

*key* is an already open key, or one of the predefined [HKEY_\* constants](#hkey-constants).

Will generally raise [`NotImplementedError`](exceptions.md#NotImplementedError) if executed on a 32-bit operating
system.

If the key is not on the reflection list, the function succeeds but has no
effect.  Disabling reflection for a key does not affect reflection of any
subkeys.

Raises an [auditing event](sys.md#auditing) `winreg.DisableReflectionKey` with argument `key`.

### winreg.EnableReflectionKey(key)

Restores registry reflection for the specified disabled key.

*key* is an already open key, or one of the predefined [HKEY_\* constants](#hkey-constants).

Will generally raise [`NotImplementedError`](exceptions.md#NotImplementedError) if executed on a 32-bit operating
system.

Restoring reflection for a key does not affect reflection of any subkeys.

Raises an [auditing event](sys.md#auditing) `winreg.EnableReflectionKey` with argument `key`.

### winreg.QueryReflectionKey(key)

Determines the reflection state for the specified key.

*key* is an already open key, or one of the predefined
[HKEY_\* constants](#hkey-constants).

Returns `True` if reflection is disabled.

Will generally raise [`NotImplementedError`](exceptions.md#NotImplementedError) if executed on a 32-bit
operating system.

Raises an [auditing event](sys.md#auditing) `winreg.QueryReflectionKey` with argument `key`.

<a id="handle-object"></a>

## Registry Handle Objects

This object wraps a Windows HKEY object, automatically closing it when the
object is destroyed.  To guarantee cleanup, you can call either the
[`Close()`](#winreg.PyHKEY.Close) method on the object, or the [`CloseKey()`](#winreg.CloseKey) function.

All registry functions in this module return one of these objects.

All registry functions in this module which accept a handle object also accept
an integer, however, use of the handle object is encouraged.

Handle objects provide semantics for [`__bool__()`](../reference/datamodel.md#object.__bool__) – thus

```python3
if handle:
    print("Yes")
```

will print `Yes` if the handle is currently valid (has not been closed or
detached).

The object also support equality comparison semantics, so handle objects will
compare equal if they both reference the same underlying Windows handle value.
Closed handle objects (those with a handle value of zero) always compare equal.

Handle objects can be converted to an integer (e.g., using the built-in
[`int()`](functions.md#int) function), in which case the underlying Windows handle value is
returned.  You can also use the [`Detach()`](#winreg.PyHKEY.Detach) method to return the
integer handle, and also disconnect the Windows handle from the handle object.

#### PyHKEY.Close()

Closes the underlying Windows handle.

If the handle is already closed, no error is raised.

#### PyHKEY.Detach()

Detaches the Windows handle from the handle object.

The result is an integer that holds the value of the handle before it is
detached.  If the handle is already detached or closed, this will return
zero.

After calling this function, the handle is effectively invalidated, but the
handle is not closed.  You would call this function when you need the
underlying Win32 handle to exist beyond the lifetime of the handle object.

Raises an [auditing event](sys.md#auditing) `winreg.PyHKEY.Detach` with argument `key`.

#### PyHKEY.\_\_enter_\_()

#### PyHKEY.\_\_exit_\_(\*exc_info)

The HKEY object implements [`__enter__()`](../reference/datamodel.md#object.__enter__) and
[`__exit__()`](../reference/datamodel.md#object.__exit__) and thus supports the context protocol for the
[`with`](../reference/compound_stmts.md#with) statement:

```python3
with OpenKey(HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, "foo") as key:
    ...  # work with key
```

will automatically close *key* when control leaves the [`with`](../reference/compound_stmts.md#with) block.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.15: Handle objects are now compared by their underlying Windows handle value
instead of object identity for equality comparisons.
