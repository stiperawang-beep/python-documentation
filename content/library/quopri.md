# `quopri` — Encode and decode MIME quoted-printable data

**Source code:** [Lib/quopri.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/main/Lib/quopri.py)

<a id="index-0"></a>

---

This module performs quoted-printable transport encoding and decoding, as
defined in [**RFC 1521**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1521.html): “MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One:
Mechanisms for Specifying and Describing the Format of Internet Message Bodies”.
The quoted-printable encoding is designed for data where there are relatively
few nonprintable characters; the base64 encoding scheme available via the
[`base64`](base64.md#module-base64) module is more compact if there are many such characters, as when
sending a graphics file.

### quopri.decode(input, output, header=False)

Decode the contents of the *input* file and write the resulting decoded binary
data to the *output* file. *input* and *output* must be [binary file objects](../glossary.md#term-file-object).  If the optional argument *header* is present and true, underscore
will be decoded as space. This is used to decode “Q”-encoded headers as
described in [**RFC 1522**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1522.html): “MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
Part Two: Message Header Extensions for Non-ASCII Text”.

### quopri.encode(input, output, quotetabs, header=False)

Encode the contents of the *input* file and write the resulting quoted-printable
data to the *output* file. *input* and *output* must be
[binary file objects](../glossary.md#term-file-object). *quotetabs*, a
non-optional flag which controls whether to encode embedded spaces
and tabs; when true it encodes such embedded whitespace, and when
false it leaves them unencoded.
Note that spaces and tabs appearing at the end of lines are always encoded,
as per [**RFC 1521**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1521.html).  *header* is a flag which controls if spaces are encoded
as underscores as per [**RFC 1522**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1522.html).

### quopri.decodestring(s, header=False)

Like [`decode()`](#quopri.decode), except that it accepts a source [`bytes`](stdtypes.md#bytes) and
returns the corresponding decoded [`bytes`](stdtypes.md#bytes).

### quopri.encodestring(s, quotetabs=False, header=False)

Like [`encode()`](#quopri.encode), except that it accepts a source [`bytes`](stdtypes.md#bytes) and
returns the corresponding encoded [`bytes`](stdtypes.md#bytes). By default, it sends a
`False` value to *quotetabs* parameter of the [`encode()`](#quopri.encode) function.
