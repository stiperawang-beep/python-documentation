# `pkgutil` — Package extension utility

**Source code:** [Lib/pkgutil.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/main/Lib/pkgutil.py)

---

This module provides utilities for the import system, in particular package
support.

### *class* pkgutil.ModuleInfo(module_finder, name, ispkg)

A namedtuple that holds a brief summary of a module’s info.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.6.

### pkgutil.extend_path(path, name)

Extend the search path for the modules which comprise a package.  Intended
use is to place the following code in a package’s `__init__.py`:

```python3
from pkgutil import extend_path
__path__ = extend_path(__path__, __name__)
```

For each directory on [`sys.path`](sys.md#sys.path) that has a subdirectory that matches the
package name, add the subdirectory to the package’s
[`__path__`](../reference/datamodel.md#module.__path__). This is useful
if one wants to distribute different parts of a single logical package as multiple
directories.

It also looks for `*.pkg` files beginning where `*` matches the
*name* argument.  This feature is similar to `*.pth` files (see the
[`site`](site.md#module-site) module for more information), except that it doesn’t special-case
lines starting with `import`.  A `*.pkg` file is trusted at face
value: apart from skipping blank lines and ignoring comments, all entries
found in a `*.pkg` file are added to the path, regardless of whether
they exist on the filesystem (this is a feature).

If the input path is not a list (as is the case for frozen packages) it is
returned unchanged.  The input path is not modified; an extended copy is
returned.  Items are only appended to the copy at the end.

It is assumed that [`sys.path`](sys.md#sys.path) is a sequence.  Items of [`sys.path`](sys.md#sys.path)
that are not strings referring to existing directories are ignored. Unicode
items on [`sys.path`](sys.md#sys.path) that cause errors when used as filenames may cause
this function to raise an exception (in line with [`os.path.isdir()`](os.path.md#os.path.isdir)
behavior).

### pkgutil.get_importer(path_item)

Retrieve a [finder](../glossary.md#term-finder) for the given *path_item*.

The returned finder is cached in [`sys.path_importer_cache`](sys.md#sys.path_importer_cache) if it was
newly created by a path hook.

The cache (or part of it) can be cleared manually if a rescan of
[`sys.path_hooks`](sys.md#sys.path_hooks) is necessary.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.3: Updated to be based directly on [`importlib`](importlib.md#module-importlib) rather than relying
on the package internal [**PEP 302**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0302/) import emulation.

### pkgutil.iter_importers(fullname='')

Yield [finder](../glossary.md#term-finder) objects for the given module name.

If *fullname* contains a `'.'`, the finders will be for the package
containing *fullname*, otherwise they will be all registered top level
finders (i.e. those on both [`sys.meta_path`](sys.md#sys.meta_path) and [`sys.path_hooks`](sys.md#sys.path_hooks)).

If the named module is in a package, that package is imported as a side
effect of invoking this function.

If no module name is specified, all top level finders are produced.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.3: Updated to be based directly on [`importlib`](importlib.md#module-importlib) rather than relying
on the package internal [**PEP 302**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0302/) import emulation.

### pkgutil.iter_modules(path=None, prefix='')

Yields [`ModuleInfo`](#pkgutil.ModuleInfo) for all submodules on *path*, or, if
*path* is `None`, all top-level modules on [`sys.path`](sys.md#sys.path).

*path* should be either `None` or a list of paths to look for modules in.

*prefix* is a string to output on the front of every module name on output.

#### NOTE
Only works for a [finder](../glossary.md#term-finder) which defines an `iter_modules()`
method. This interface is non-standard, so the module also provides
implementations for [`importlib.machinery.FileFinder`](importlib.md#importlib.machinery.FileFinder) and
[`zipimport.zipimporter`](zipimport.md#zipimport.zipimporter).

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.3: Updated to be based directly on [`importlib`](importlib.md#module-importlib) rather than relying
on the package internal [**PEP 302**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0302/) import emulation.

### pkgutil.walk_packages(path=None, prefix='', onerror=None)

Yields [`ModuleInfo`](#pkgutil.ModuleInfo) for all modules recursively on
*path*, or, if *path* is `None`, all accessible modules.

*path* should be either `None` or a list of paths to look for modules in.

*prefix* is a string to output on the front of every module name on output.

Note that this function must import all *packages* (*not* all modules!) on
the given *path*, in order to access the `__path__` attribute to find
submodules.

*onerror* is a function which gets called with one argument (the name of the
package which was being imported) if any exception occurs while trying to
import a package.  If no *onerror* function is supplied, [`ImportError`](exceptions.md#ImportError)s
are caught and ignored, while all other exceptions are propagated,
terminating the search.

Examples:

```python3
# list all modules python can access
walk_packages()

# list all submodules of ctypes
walk_packages(ctypes.__path__, ctypes.__name__ + '.')
```

#### NOTE
Only works for a [finder](../glossary.md#term-finder) which defines an `iter_modules()`
method. This interface is non-standard, so the module also provides
implementations for [`importlib.machinery.FileFinder`](importlib.md#importlib.machinery.FileFinder) and
[`zipimport.zipimporter`](zipimport.md#zipimport.zipimporter).

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.3: Updated to be based directly on [`importlib`](importlib.md#module-importlib) rather than relying
on the package internal [**PEP 302**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0302/) import emulation.

### pkgutil.get_data(package, resource)

Get a resource from a package.

This is a wrapper for the [loader](../glossary.md#term-loader)
[`get_data`](importlib.md#importlib.abc.ResourceLoader.get_data) API.  The
*package* argument should be the name of a package, in standard module format
(`foo.bar`).  The *resource* argument should be in the form of a relative
filename, using `/` as the path separator.

The function returns a binary string that is the contents of the specified
resource.

This function uses the [loader](../glossary.md#term-loader) method
[`get_data()`](importlib.md#importlib.abc.FileLoader.get_data)
to support modules installed in the filesystem, but also in zip files,
databases, or elsewhere.

For packages located in the filesystem, which have already been imported,
this is the rough equivalent of:

```python3
d = os.path.dirname(sys.modules[package].__file__)
data = open(os.path.join(d, resource), 'rb').read()
```

Like the [`open()`](functions.md#open) function, `get_data()` can follow parent
directories (`../`) and absolute paths (starting with `/` or `C:/`,
for example).
It can open compilation/installation artifacts like `.py` and `.pyc`
files or files with [`reserved filenames`](os.path.md#os.path.isreserved).
To be compatible with non-filesystem loaders, avoid using these features.

#### WARNING
This function is intended for trusted input.
It does not verify that *resource* “belongs” to *package*.

If you use a user-provided *resource* path, consider verifying it.
For example, require an alphanumeric filename with a known extension, or
install and check a list of known resources.

If the package cannot be located or loaded, or it uses a [loader](../glossary.md#term-loader)
which does not support [`get_data`](importlib.md#importlib.abc.ResourceLoader.get_data),
then `None` is returned.  In particular, the [loader](../glossary.md#term-loader) for
[namespace packages](../glossary.md#term-namespace-package) does not support
[`get_data`](importlib.md#importlib.abc.ResourceLoader.get_data).

#### SEE ALSO
The [`importlib.resources`](importlib.resources.md#module-importlib.resources) module provides structured access to
module resources.

### pkgutil.resolve_name(name)

Resolve a name to an object.

This functionality is used in numerous places in the standard library (see
[bpo-12915](https://bugs.python.org/issue?@action=redirect&bpo=12915)) - and equivalent functionality is also in widely used
third-party packages such as setuptools, Django and Pyramid.

It is expected that *name* will be a string in one of the following
formats, where W is shorthand for a valid Python identifier and dot stands
for a literal period in these pseudo-regexes:

* `W(.W)*`
* `W(.W)*:(W(.W)*)?`

The first form is intended for backward compatibility only. It assumes that
some part of the dotted name is a package, and the rest is an object
somewhere within that package, possibly nested inside other objects.
Because the place where the package stops and the object hierarchy starts
can’t be inferred by inspection, repeated attempts to import must be done
with this form.

In the second form, the caller makes the division point clear through the
provision of a single colon: the dotted name to the left of the colon is a
package to be imported, and the dotted name to the right is the object
hierarchy within that package. Only one import is needed in this form. If
it ends with the colon, then a module object is returned.

The function will return an object (which might be a module), or raise one
of the following exceptions:

[`ValueError`](exceptions.md#ValueError) – if *name* isn’t in a recognised format.

[`ImportError`](exceptions.md#ImportError) – if an import failed when it shouldn’t have.

[`AttributeError`](exceptions.md#AttributeError) – If a failure occurred when traversing the object
hierarchy within the imported package to get to the desired object.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.9.
