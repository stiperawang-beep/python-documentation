# Developing with asyncio

Asynchronous programming is different from classic “sequential”
programming.

This page lists common mistakes and traps and explains how
to avoid them.

<a id="asyncio-debug-mode"></a>

## Debug Mode

By default asyncio runs in production mode.  In order to ease
the development asyncio has a *debug mode*.

There are several ways to enable asyncio debug mode:

* Setting the [`PYTHONASYNCIODEBUG`](../using/cmdline.md#envvar-PYTHONASYNCIODEBUG) environment variable to `1`.
* Using the [Python Development Mode](devmode.md#devmode).
* Passing `debug=True` to [`asyncio.run()`](asyncio-runner.md#asyncio.run).
* Calling [`loop.set_debug()`](asyncio-eventloop.md#asyncio.loop.set_debug).

In addition to enabling the debug mode, consider also:

* setting the log level of the [asyncio logger](#asyncio-logger) to
  [`logging.DEBUG`](logging.md#logging.DEBUG), for example the following snippet of code
  can be run at startup of the application:
  ```python3
  logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
  ```
* configuring the [`warnings`](warnings.md#module-warnings) module to display
  [`ResourceWarning`](exceptions.md#ResourceWarning) warnings.  One way of doing that is by
  using the [`-W`](../using/cmdline.md#cmdoption-W) `default` command line option.

When the debug mode is enabled:

* Many non-threadsafe asyncio APIs (such as [`loop.call_soon()`](asyncio-eventloop.md#asyncio.loop.call_soon) and
  [`loop.call_at()`](asyncio-eventloop.md#asyncio.loop.call_at) methods) raise an exception if they are called
  from a wrong thread.
* The execution time of the I/O selector is logged if it takes too long to
  perform an I/O operation.
* Callbacks taking longer than 100 milliseconds are logged.  The
  [`loop.slow_callback_duration`](asyncio-eventloop.md#asyncio.loop.slow_callback_duration) attribute can be used to set the
  minimum execution duration in seconds that is considered “slow”.

## Concurrency and Multithreading

An event loop runs in a thread (typically the main thread) and executes
all callbacks and Tasks in its thread.  While a Task is running in the
event loop, no other Tasks can run in the same thread.  When a Task
executes an `await` expression, the running Task gets suspended, and
the event loop executes the next Task.

To schedule a [callback](../glossary.md#term-callback) from another OS thread, the
[`loop.call_soon_threadsafe()`](asyncio-eventloop.md#asyncio.loop.call_soon_threadsafe) method should be used. Example:

```python3
loop.call_soon_threadsafe(callback, *args)
```

Almost all asyncio objects are not thread safe, which is typically
not a problem unless there is code that works with them from outside
of a Task or a callback.  If there’s a need for such code to call a
low-level asyncio API, the [`loop.call_soon_threadsafe()`](asyncio-eventloop.md#asyncio.loop.call_soon_threadsafe) method
should be used, e.g.:

```python3
loop.call_soon_threadsafe(fut.cancel)
```

To schedule a coroutine object from a different OS thread, the
[`run_coroutine_threadsafe()`](asyncio-task.md#asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe) function should be used. It returns a
[`concurrent.futures.Future`](concurrent.futures.md#concurrent.futures.Future) to access the result:

```python3
async def coro_func():
     return await asyncio.sleep(1, 42)

# Later in another OS thread:

future = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro_func(), loop)
# Wait for the result:
result = future.result()
```

To handle signals the event loop must be
run in the main thread.

The [`loop.run_in_executor()`](asyncio-eventloop.md#asyncio.loop.run_in_executor) method can be used with a
[`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`](concurrent.futures.md#concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor) or
[`InterpreterPoolExecutor`](concurrent.futures.md#concurrent.futures.InterpreterPoolExecutor) to execute
blocking code in a different OS thread without blocking the OS thread
that the event loop runs in.

There is currently no way to schedule coroutines or callbacks directly
from a different process (such as one started with
[`multiprocessing`](multiprocessing.md#module-multiprocessing)). The [Event loop methods](asyncio-eventloop.md#asyncio-event-loop-methods)
section lists APIs that can read from pipes and watch file descriptors
without blocking the event loop. In addition, asyncio’s
[Subprocess](asyncio-subprocess.md#asyncio-subprocess) APIs provide a way to start a
process and communicate with it from the event loop. Lastly, the
aforementioned [`loop.run_in_executor()`](asyncio-eventloop.md#asyncio.loop.run_in_executor) method can also be used
with a [`concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`](concurrent.futures.md#concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor) to execute
code in a different process.

## Running Blocking Code

Blocking (CPU-bound) code should not be called directly.  For example,
if a function performs a CPU-intensive calculation for 1 second,
all concurrent asyncio Tasks and IO operations would be delayed
by 1 second.

An executor can be used to run a task in a different thread,
including in a different interpreter, or even in
a different process to avoid blocking the OS thread with the
event loop.  See the [`loop.run_in_executor()`](asyncio-eventloop.md#asyncio.loop.run_in_executor) method for more
details.

<a id="asyncio-logger"></a>

## Logging

asyncio uses the [`logging`](logging.md#module-logging) module and all logging is performed
via the `"asyncio"` logger.

The default log level is [`logging.INFO`](logging.md#logging.INFO), which can be easily
adjusted:

```python3
logging.getLogger("asyncio").setLevel(logging.WARNING)
```

Network logging can block the event loop. It is recommended to use
a separate thread for handling logs or use non-blocking IO. For example,
see [Dealing with handlers that block](../howto/logging-cookbook.md#blocking-handlers).

## Detect never-awaited coroutines

When a coroutine function is called, but not awaited
(e.g. `coro()` instead of `await coro()`)
or the coroutine is not scheduled with [`asyncio.create_task()`](asyncio-task.md#asyncio.create_task), asyncio
will emit a [`RuntimeWarning`](exceptions.md#RuntimeWarning):

```python3
import asyncio

async def test():
    print("never scheduled")

async def main():
    test()

asyncio.run(main())
```

Output:

```python3
test.py:7: RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'test' was never awaited
  test()
```

Output in debug mode:

```python3
test.py:7: RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'test' was never awaited
Coroutine created at (most recent call last)
  File "../t.py", line 9, in <module>
    asyncio.run(main(), debug=True)

  < .. >

  File "../t.py", line 7, in main
    test()
  test()
```

The usual fix is to either await the coroutine or call the
[`asyncio.create_task()`](asyncio-task.md#asyncio.create_task) function:

```python3
async def main():
    await test()
```

## Detect never-retrieved exceptions

If a [`Future.set_exception()`](asyncio-future.md#asyncio.Future.set_exception) is called but the Future object is
never awaited on, the exception would never be propagated to the
user code.  In this case, asyncio would emit a log message when the
Future object is garbage collected.

Example of an unhandled exception:

```python3
import asyncio

async def bug():
    raise Exception("not consumed")

async def main():
    asyncio.create_task(bug())

asyncio.run(main())
```

Output:

```python3
Task exception was never retrieved
future: <Task finished coro=<bug() done, defined at test.py:3>
  exception=Exception('not consumed')>

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 4, in bug
    raise Exception("not consumed")
Exception: not consumed
```

[Enable the debug mode](#asyncio-debug-mode) to get the
traceback where the task was created:

```python3
asyncio.run(main(), debug=True)
```

Output in debug mode:

```python3
Task exception was never retrieved
future: <Task finished coro=<bug() done, defined at test.py:3>
    exception=Exception('not consumed') created at asyncio/tasks.py:321>

source_traceback: Object created at (most recent call last):
  File "../t.py", line 9, in <module>
    asyncio.run(main(), debug=True)

< .. >

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "../t.py", line 4, in bug
    raise Exception("not consumed")
Exception: not consumed
```

## Asynchronous generators best practices

Writing correct and efficient asyncio code requires awareness of certain pitfalls.
This section outlines essential best practices that can save you hours of debugging.

### Close asynchronous generators explicitly

It is recommended to manually close the
[asynchronous generator](../glossary.md#term-asynchronous-generator-iterator). If a generator
exits early - for example, due to an exception raised in the body of
an `async for` loop - its asynchronous cleanup code may run in an
unexpected context. This can occur after the tasks it depends on have completed,
or during the event loop shutdown when the async-generator’s garbage collection
hook is called.

To avoid this, explicitly close the generator by calling its
[`aclose()`](../reference/expressions.md#agen.aclose) method, or use the [`contextlib.aclosing()`](contextlib.md#contextlib.aclosing)
context manager:

```python3
import asyncio
import contextlib

async def gen():
  yield 1
  yield 2

async def func():
  async with contextlib.aclosing(gen()) as g:
    async for x in g:
      break  # Don't iterate until the end

asyncio.run(func())
```

As noted above, the cleanup code for these asynchronous generators is deferred.
The following example demonstrates that the finalization of an asynchronous
generator can occur in an unexpected order:

```python3
import asyncio
work_done = False

async def cursor():
    try:
        yield 1
    finally:
        assert work_done

async def rows():
    global work_done
    try:
        yield 2
    finally:
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1) # imitate some async work
        work_done = True


async def main():
    async for c in cursor():
        async for r in rows():
            break
        break

asyncio.run(main())
```

For this example, we get the following output:

```python3
unhandled exception during asyncio.run() shutdown
task: <Task finished name='Task-3' coro=<<async_generator_athrow without __name__>()> exception=AssertionError()>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "example.py", line 6, in cursor
    yield 1
asyncio.exceptions.CancelledError

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "example.py", line 8, in cursor
    assert work_done
           ^^^^^^^^^
AssertionError
```

The `cursor()` asynchronous generator was finalized before the `rows`
generator - an unexpected behavior.

The example can be fixed by explicitly closing the
`cursor` and `rows` async-generators:

```python3
async def main():
    async with contextlib.aclosing(cursor()) as cursor_gen:
        async for c in cursor_gen:
            async with contextlib.aclosing(rows()) as rows_gen:
                async for r in rows_gen:
                    break
            break
```

### Create asynchronous generators only when the event loop is running

It is recommended to create
[asynchronous generators](../glossary.md#term-asynchronous-generator-iterator) only after
the event loop has been created.

To ensure that asynchronous generators close reliably, the event loop uses the
[`sys.set_asyncgen_hooks()`](sys.md#sys.set_asyncgen_hooks) function to register callback functions. These
callbacks update the list of running asynchronous generators to keep it in a
consistent state.

When the [`loop.shutdown_asyncgens()`](asyncio-eventloop.md#asyncio.loop.shutdown_asyncgens)
function is called, the running generators are stopped gracefully and the
list is cleared.

The asynchronous generator invokes the corresponding system hook during its
first iteration. At the same time, the generator records that the hook has
been called and does not call it again.

Therefore, if iteration begins before the event loop is created,
the event loop will not be able to add the generator to its list of active
generators because the hooks are set after the generator attempts to call them.
Consequently, the event loop will not be able to terminate the generator
if necessary.

Consider the following example:

```python3
import asyncio

async def agenfn():
    try:
        yield 10
    finally:
        await asyncio.sleep(0)


with asyncio.Runner() as runner:
    agen = agenfn()
    print(runner.run(anext(agen)))
    del agen
```

Output:

```python3
10
Exception ignored while closing generator <async_generator object agenfn at 0x000002F71CD10D70>:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "example.py", line 13, in <module>
    del agen
        ^^^^
RuntimeError: async generator ignored GeneratorExit
```

This example can be fixed as follows:

```python3
import asyncio

async def agenfn():
    try:
        yield 10
    finally:
        await asyncio.sleep(0)

async def main():
    agen = agenfn()
    print(await anext(agen))
    del agen

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Avoid concurrent iteration and closure of the same generator

Async generators may be reentered while another
[`__anext__()`](../reference/expressions.md#agen.__anext__) / [`athrow()`](../reference/expressions.md#agen.athrow) / [`aclose()`](../reference/expressions.md#agen.aclose) call is in
progress. This may lead to an inconsistent state of the async generator and can
cause errors.

Let’s consider the following example:

```python3
import asyncio

async def consumer():
    for idx in range(100):
        await asyncio.sleep(0)
        message = yield idx
        print('received', message)

async def amain():
    agenerator = consumer()
    await agenerator.asend(None)

    fa = asyncio.create_task(agenerator.asend('A'))
    fb = asyncio.create_task(agenerator.asend('B'))
    await fa
    await fb

asyncio.run(amain())
```

Output:

```python3
received A
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 38, in <module>
    asyncio.run(amain())
    ~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^
  File "Lib/asyncio/runners.py", line 204, in run
    return runner.run(main)
           ~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^
  File "Lib/asyncio/runners.py", line 127, in run
    return self._loop.run_until_complete(task)
           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^
  File "Lib/asyncio/base_events.py", line 719, in run_until_complete
    return future.result()
           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^
  File "test.py", line 36, in amain
    await fb
RuntimeError: anext(): asynchronous generator is already running
```

Therefore, it is recommended to avoid using asynchronous generators in parallel
tasks or across multiple event loops.
