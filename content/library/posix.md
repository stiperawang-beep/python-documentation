# `posix` — The most common POSIX system calls

---

This module provides access to operating system functionality that is
standardized by the C Standard and the POSIX standard (a thinly disguised Unix
interface).

[Availability](intro.md#availability): Unix.

**Do not import this module directly.**  Instead, import the module [`os`](os.md#module-os),
which provides a *portable* version of this interface.  On Unix, the [`os`](os.md#module-os)
module provides a superset of the `posix` interface.  On non-Unix operating
systems the `posix` module is not available, but a subset is always
available through the [`os`](os.md#module-os) interface.  Once [`os`](os.md#module-os) is imported, there is
*no* performance penalty in using it instead of `posix`.  In addition,
[`os`](os.md#module-os) provides some additional functionality, such as automatically calling
[`putenv()`](os.md#os.putenv) when an entry in `os.environ` is changed.

Errors are reported as exceptions; the usual exceptions are given for type
errors, while errors reported by the system calls raise [`OSError`](exceptions.md#OSError).

## Large File Support

<a id="index-1"></a>

Several operating systems (including AIX and Solaris) provide
support for files that are larger than 2 GiB from a C programming model where
 and  are 32-bit values. This is typically accomplished
by defining the relevant size and offset types as 64-bit values. Such files are
sometimes referred to as *large files*.

Large file support is enabled in Python when the size of an `off_t` is
larger than a  and the  is at least as large
as an `off_t`.
It may be necessary to configure and compile Python with certain compiler flags
to enable this mode. For example, with Solaris 2.6 and 2.7 you need to do
something like:

```python3
CFLAGS="`getconf LFS_CFLAGS`" OPT="-g -O2 $CFLAGS" \
        ./configure
```

On large-file-capable Linux systems, this might work:

```python3
CFLAGS='-D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64' OPT="-g -O2 $CFLAGS" \
        ./configure
```

## Notable Module Contents

In addition to many functions described in the [`os`](os.md#module-os) module documentation,
`posix` defines the following data item:

### posix.environ

A dictionary representing the string environment at the time the interpreter
was started. Keys and values are bytes on Unix and str on Windows. For
example, `environ[b'HOME']` (`environ['HOME']` on Windows) is the
pathname of your home directory, equivalent to `getenv("HOME")` in C.

Modifying this dictionary does not affect the string environment passed on by
[`execv()`](os.md#os.execv), [`popen()`](os.md#os.popen) or [`system()`](os.md#os.system); if you need to
change the environment, pass `environ` to [`execve()`](os.md#os.execve) or add
variable assignments and export statements to the command string for
[`system()`](os.md#os.system) or [`popen()`](os.md#os.popen).

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.2: On Unix, keys and values are bytes.

#### NOTE
The [`os`](os.md#module-os) module provides an alternate implementation of `environ`
which updates the environment on modification. Note also that updating
[`os.environ`](os.md#os.environ) will render this dictionary obsolete. Use of the
[`os`](os.md#module-os) module version of this is recommended over direct access to the
`posix` module.
