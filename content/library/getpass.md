<!-- include for modules that don't work on WASM -->

[Availability](intro.md#availability): not WASI.

This module does not work or is not available on WebAssembly. See
[WebAssembly platforms](intro.md#wasm-availability) for more information.

The `getpass` module provides two functions:

### getpass.getpass(prompt='Password: ', stream=None, , echo_char=None)

Prompt the user for a password without echoing.  The user is prompted using
the string *prompt*, which defaults to `'Password: '`.  On Unix, the
prompt is written to the file-like object *stream* using the replace error
handler if needed.  *stream* defaults to the controlling terminal
(`/dev/tty`) or if that is unavailable to `sys.stderr` (this
argument is ignored on Windows).

The *echo_char* argument controls how user input is displayed while typing.
If *echo_char* is `None` (default), input remains hidden. Otherwise,
*echo_char* must be a single printable ASCII character and each
typed character is replaced by it. For example, `echo_char='*'` will
display asterisks instead of the actual input.

If echo free input is unavailable getpass() falls back to printing
a warning message to *stream* and reading from `sys.stdin` and
issuing a [`GetPassWarning`](#getpass.GetPassWarning).

#### NOTE
If you call getpass from within IDLE, the input may be done in the
terminal you launched IDLE from rather than the idle window itself.

#### NOTE
On Unix systems, when *echo_char* is set, the terminal will be
configured to operate in
.
Common terminal control characters are supported:

* `Ctrl`+`A` - Move cursor to beginning of line
* `Ctrl`+`E` - Move cursor to end of line
* `Ctrl`+`K` - Kill (delete) from cursor to end of line
* `Ctrl`+`U` - Kill (delete) entire line
* `Ctrl`+`W` - Erase previous word
* `Ctrl`+`V` - Insert next character literally (quote)
* `Backspace`/`DEL` - Delete character before cursor

These shortcuts work by reading the terminal’s configured control
character mappings from termios settings.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.14: Added the *echo_char* parameter for keyboard feedback.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.15: When using non-empty *echo_char* on Unix, keyboard shortcuts (including
cursor movement and line editing) are now properly handled using the
terminal’s control character configuration.

### *exception* getpass.GetPassWarning

A [`UserWarning`](exceptions.md#UserWarning) subclass issued when password input may be echoed.

### getpass.getuser()

Return the “login name” of the user.

This function checks the environment variables `LOGNAME`,
`USER`, `LNAME` and `USERNAME`, in order, and
returns the value of the first one which is set to a non-empty string.  If
none are set, the login name from the password database is returned on
systems which support the [`pwd`](pwd.md#module-pwd) module, otherwise, an [`OSError`](exceptions.md#OSError)
is raised.

In general, this function should be preferred over [`os.getlogin()`](os.md#os.getlogin).

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.13: Previously, various exceptions beyond just [`OSError`](exceptions.md#OSError) were raised.
