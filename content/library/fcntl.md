# `fcntl` — The `fcntl` and `ioctl` system calls

<a id="index-0"></a>

---

This module performs file and I/O control on file descriptors. It is an
interface to the `fcntl()` and `ioctl()` Unix routines.
See the  and  Unix manual pages
for full details.

[Availability](intro.md#availability): Unix, not WASI.

All functions in this module take a file descriptor *fd* as their first
argument.  This can be an integer file descriptor, such as returned by
`sys.stdin.fileno()`, or an [`io.IOBase`](io.md#io.IOBase) object, such as `sys.stdin`
itself, which provides a [`fileno()`](io.md#io.IOBase.fileno) that returns a genuine file
descriptor.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.3: Operations in this module used to raise an [`IOError`](exceptions.md#IOError) where they now
raise an [`OSError`](exceptions.md#OSError).

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.8: The `fcntl` module now contains `F_ADD_SEALS`, `F_GET_SEALS`, and
`F_SEAL_*` constants for sealing of [`os.memfd_create()`](os.md#os.memfd_create) file
descriptors.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.9: On macOS, the `fcntl` module exposes the `F_GETPATH` constant,
which obtains the path of a file from a file descriptor.
On Linux(>=3.15), the `fcntl` module exposes the `F_OFD_GETLK`,
`F_OFD_SETLK` and `F_OFD_SETLKW` constants, which are used when working
with open file description locks.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.10: On Linux >= 2.6.11, the `fcntl` module exposes the `F_GETPIPE_SZ` and
`F_SETPIPE_SZ` constants, which allow to check and modify a pipe’s size
respectively.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.11: On FreeBSD, the `fcntl` module exposes the `F_DUP2FD` and
`F_DUP2FD_CLOEXEC` constants, which allow to duplicate a file descriptor,
the latter setting `FD_CLOEXEC` flag in addition.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.12: On Linux >= 4.5, the `fcntl` module exposes the `FICLONE` and
`FICLONERANGE` constants, which allow to share some data of one file with
another file by reflinking on some filesystems (e.g., btrfs, OCFS2, and
XFS). This behavior is commonly referred to as “copy-on-write”.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.13: On Linux >= 2.6.32, the `fcntl` module exposes the
`F_GETOWN_EX`, `F_SETOWN_EX`, `F_OWNER_TID`, `F_OWNER_PID`, `F_OWNER_PGRP` constants, which allow to direct I/O availability signals
to a specific thread, process, or process group.
On Linux >= 4.13, the `fcntl` module exposes the
`F_GET_RW_HINT`, `F_SET_RW_HINT`, `F_GET_FILE_RW_HINT`,
`F_SET_FILE_RW_HINT`, and `RWH_WRITE_LIFE_*` constants, which allow
to inform the kernel about the relative expected lifetime of writes on
a given inode or via a particular open file description.
On Linux >= 5.1 and NetBSD, the `fcntl` module exposes the
`F_SEAL_FUTURE_WRITE` constant for use with `F_ADD_SEALS` and
`F_GET_SEALS` operations.
On FreeBSD, the `fcntl` module exposes the `F_READAHEAD`, `F_ISUNIONSTACK`, and `F_KINFO` constants.
On macOS and FreeBSD, the `fcntl` module exposes the `F_RDAHEAD`
constant.
On NetBSD and AIX, the `fcntl` module exposes the `F_CLOSEM`
constant.
On NetBSD, the `fcntl` module exposes the `F_MAXFD` constant.
On macOS and NetBSD, the `fcntl` module exposes the `F_GETNOSIGPIPE`
and `F_SETNOSIGPIPE` constant.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.14: On Linux >= 6.1, the `fcntl` module exposes the `F_DUPFD_QUERY`
to query a file descriptor pointing to the same file.

The module defines the following functions:

### fcntl.fcntl(fd, cmd, arg=0,)

Perform the operation *cmd* on file descriptor *fd* (file objects providing
a [`fileno()`](io.md#io.IOBase.fileno) method are accepted as well).  The values used
for *cmd* are operating system dependent, and are available as constants
in the `fcntl` module, using the same names as used in the relevant C
header files. The argument *arg* can either be an integer value, a
[bytes-like object](../glossary.md#term-bytes-like-object), or a string.
The type and size of *arg* must match the type and size of
the argument of the operation as specified in the relevant C documentation.

When *arg* is an integer, the function returns the integer
return value of the C `fcntl()` call.

When the argument is bytes-like object, it represents a binary structure,
for example, created by [`struct.pack()`](struct.md#struct.pack).
A string value is encoded to binary using the UTF-8 encoding.
The binary data is copied to a buffer whose address is
passed to the C `fcntl()` call.  The return value after a successful
call is the contents of the buffer, converted to a [`bytes`](stdtypes.md#bytes) object.
The length of the returned object will be the same as the length of the
*arg* argument.

If the `fcntl()` call fails, an [`OSError`](exceptions.md#OSError) is raised.

#### NOTE
If the type or size of *arg* does not match the type or size
of the operation’s argument (for example, if an integer is
passed when a pointer is expected, or the information returned in
the buffer by the operating system is larger than the size of *arg*),
this is most likely to result in a segmentation violation or
a more subtle data corruption.

Raises an [auditing event](sys.md#auditing) `fcntl.fcntl` with arguments `fd`, `cmd`, `arg`.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.14: Add support of arbitrary [bytes-like objects](../glossary.md#term-bytes-like-object),
not only [`bytes`](stdtypes.md#bytes).

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.15: The size of bytes-like objects is no longer limited to 1024 bytes.

### fcntl.ioctl(fd, request, arg=0, mutate_flag=True,)

This function is identical to the [`fcntl()`](#fcntl.fcntl) function, except
that the argument handling is even more complicated.

The *request* parameter is limited to values that can fit in 32-bits
or 64-bits, depending on the platform.
Additional constants of interest for use as the *request* argument can be
found in the [`termios`](termios.md#module-termios) module, under the same names as used in
the relevant C header files.

The parameter *arg* can be an integer, a [bytes-like object](../glossary.md#term-bytes-like-object),
or a string.
The type and size of *arg* must match the type and size of
the argument of the operation as specified in the relevant C documentation.

If *arg* does not support the read-write buffer interface or
the *mutate_flag* is false, behavior is as for the [`fcntl()`](#fcntl.fcntl)
function.

If *arg* supports the read-write buffer interface (like [`bytearray`](stdtypes.md#bytearray))
and *mutate_flag* is true (the default), then the buffer is (in effect) passed
to the underlying `ioctl()` system call, the latter’s return code is
passed back to the calling Python, and the buffer’s new contents reflect the
action of the `ioctl()`.  This is a slight simplification, because if the
supplied buffer is less than 1024 bytes long it is first copied into a static
buffer 1024 bytes long which is then passed to [`ioctl()`](#fcntl.ioctl) and copied back
into the supplied buffer.

If the `ioctl()` call fails, an [`OSError`](exceptions.md#OSError) exception is raised.

#### NOTE
If the type or size of *arg* does not match the type or size
of the operation’s argument (for example, if an integer is
passed when a pointer is expected, or the information returned in
the buffer by the operating system is larger than the size of *arg*),
this is most likely to result in a segmentation violation or
a more subtle data corruption.

An example:

```python3
>>> import array, fcntl, struct, termios, os
>>> os.getpgrp()
13341
>>> struct.unpack('h', fcntl.ioctl(0, termios.TIOCGPGRP, "  "))[0]
13341
>>> buf = array.array('h', [0])
>>> fcntl.ioctl(0, termios.TIOCGPGRP, buf, 1)
0
>>> buf
array('h', [13341])
```

Raises an [auditing event](sys.md#auditing) `fcntl.ioctl` with arguments `fd`, `request`, `arg`.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.14: The GIL is always released during a system call.
System calls failing with EINTR are automatically retried.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.15: The size of not mutated bytes-like objects is no longer
limited to 1024 bytes.

### fcntl.flock(fd, operation,)

Perform the lock operation *operation* on file descriptor *fd* (file objects providing
a [`fileno()`](io.md#io.IOBase.fileno) method are accepted as well). See the Unix manual
 for details.  (On some systems, this function is emulated
using `fcntl()`.)

If the `flock()` call fails, an [`OSError`](exceptions.md#OSError) exception is raised.

Raises an [auditing event](sys.md#auditing) `fcntl.flock` with arguments `fd`, `operation`.

### fcntl.lockf(fd, cmd, len=0, start=0, whence=0,)

This is essentially a wrapper around the [`fcntl()`](#fcntl.fcntl) locking calls.
*fd* is the file descriptor (file objects providing a [`fileno()`](io.md#io.IOBase.fileno)
method are accepted as well) of the file to lock or unlock, and *cmd*
is one of the following values:

### fcntl.LOCK_UN

Release an existing lock.

### fcntl.LOCK_SH

Acquire a shared lock.

### fcntl.LOCK_EX

Acquire an exclusive lock.

### fcntl.LOCK_NB

Bitwise OR with any of the other three `LOCK_*` constants to make
the request non-blocking.

If `LOCK_NB` is used and the lock cannot be acquired, an
[`OSError`](exceptions.md#OSError) will be raised and the exception will have an *errno*
attribute set to [`EACCES`](errno.md#errno.EACCES) or [`EAGAIN`](errno.md#errno.EAGAIN) (depending on the
operating system; for portability, check for both values).  On at least some
systems, `LOCK_EX` can only be used if the file descriptor refers to a
file opened for writing.

*len* is the number of bytes to lock, *start* is the byte offset at
which the lock starts, relative to *whence*, and *whence* is as with
[`io.IOBase.seek()`](io.md#io.IOBase.seek), specifically:

* `0` – relative to the start of the file ([`os.SEEK_SET`](os.md#os.SEEK_SET))
* `1` – relative to the current buffer position ([`os.SEEK_CUR`](os.md#os.SEEK_CUR))
* `2` – relative to the end of the file ([`os.SEEK_END`](os.md#os.SEEK_END))

The default for *start* is 0, which means to start at the beginning of the file.
The default for *len* is 0 which means to lock to the end of the file.  The
default for *whence* is also 0.

Raises an [auditing event](sys.md#auditing) `fcntl.lockf` with arguments `fd`, `cmd`, `len`, `start`, `whence`.

Examples (all on a SVR4 compliant system):

```python3
import struct, fcntl, os

f = open(...)
rv = fcntl.fcntl(f, fcntl.F_SETFL, os.O_NDELAY)

lockdata = struct.pack('hhllhh', fcntl.F_WRLCK, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
rv = fcntl.fcntl(f, fcntl.F_SETLKW, lockdata)
```

Note that in the first example the return value variable *rv* will hold an
integer value; in the second example it will hold a [`bytes`](stdtypes.md#bytes) object.  The
structure lay-out for the *lockdata* variable is system dependent — therefore
using the [`flock()`](#fcntl.flock) call may be better.

#### SEE ALSO
Module [`os`](os.md#module-os)
: If the locking flags [`O_SHLOCK`](os.md#os.O_SHLOCK) and [`O_EXLOCK`](os.md#os.O_EXLOCK) are
  present in the [`os`](os.md#module-os) module (on BSD only), the [`os.open()`](os.md#os.open)
  function provides an alternative to the [`lockf()`](#fcntl.lockf) and [`flock()`](#fcntl.flock)
  functions.
