# `typing` — Support for type hints

<!-- import typing
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import * -->

<a id="module-typing"></a>

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.5.

**Source code:** [Lib/typing.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/main/Lib/typing.py)

#### NOTE
The Python runtime does not enforce function and variable type annotations.
They can be used by third party tools such as [type checkers](../glossary.md#term-static-type-checker),
IDEs, linters, etc.

---

This module provides runtime support for type hints.

Consider the function below:

```python3
def surface_area_of_cube(edge_length: float) -> str:
    return f"The surface area of the cube is {6 * edge_length ** 2}."
```

The function `surface_area_of_cube` takes an argument expected to
be an instance of [`float`](functions.md#float), as indicated by the [type hint](../glossary.md#term-type-hint)
`edge_length: float`. The function is expected to return an instance
of [`str`](stdtypes.md#str), as indicated by the `-> str` hint.

While type hints can be simple classes like [`float`](functions.md#float) or [`str`](stdtypes.md#str),
they can also be more complex. The [`typing`](#module-typing) module provides a vocabulary of
more advanced type hints.

New features are frequently added to the `typing` module.
The [typing_extensions](https://pypi.org/project/typing_extensions/) package
provides backports of these new features to older versions of Python.

## Specification for the Python Type System

The canonical, up-to-date specification of the Python type system can be
found at [Specification for the Python type system](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/index.html).

<a id="type-aliases"></a>

## Type aliases

A type alias is defined using the [`type`](../reference/simple_stmts.md#type) statement, which creates
an instance of [`TypeAliasType`](#typing.TypeAliasType). In this example,
`Vector` and `list[float]` will be treated equivalently by static type
checkers:

```python3
type Vector = list[float]

def scale(scalar: float, vector: Vector) -> Vector:
    return [scalar * num for num in vector]

# passes type checking; a list of floats qualifies as a Vector.
new_vector = scale(2.0, [1.0, -4.2, 5.4])
```

Type aliases are useful for simplifying complex type signatures. For example:

```python3
from collections.abc import Sequence

type ConnectionOptions = dict[str, str]
type Address = tuple[str, int]
type Server = tuple[Address, ConnectionOptions]

def broadcast_message(message: str, servers: Sequence[Server]) -> None:
    ...

# The static type checker will treat the previous type signature as
# being exactly equivalent to this one.
def broadcast_message(
    message: str,
    servers: Sequence[tuple[tuple[str, int], dict[str, str]]]
) -> None:
    ...
```

The [`type`](../reference/simple_stmts.md#type) statement is new in Python 3.12. For backwards
compatibility, type aliases can also be created through simple assignment:

```python3
Vector = list[float]
```

Or marked with [`TypeAlias`](#typing.TypeAlias) to make it explicit that this is a type alias,
not a normal variable assignment:

```python3
from typing import TypeAlias

Vector: TypeAlias = list[float]
```

<a id="distinct"></a>

## NewType

Use the [`NewType`](#typing.NewType) helper to create distinct types:

```python3
from typing import NewType

UserId = NewType('UserId', int)
some_id = UserId(524313)
```

The static type checker will treat the new type as if it were a subclass
of the original type. This is useful in helping catch logical errors:

```python3
def get_user_name(user_id: UserId) -> str:
    ...

# passes type checking
user_a = get_user_name(UserId(42351))

# fails type checking; an int is not a UserId
user_b = get_user_name(-1)
```

You may still perform all `int` operations on a variable of type `UserId`,
but the result will always be of type `int`. This lets you pass in a
`UserId` wherever an `int` might be expected, but will prevent you from
accidentally creating a `UserId` in an invalid way:

```python3
# 'output' is of type 'int', not 'UserId'
output = UserId(23413) + UserId(54341)
```

Note that these checks are enforced only by the static type checker. At runtime,
the statement `Derived = NewType('Derived', Base)` will make `Derived` a
callable that immediately returns whatever parameter you pass it. That means
the expression `Derived(some_value)` does not create a new class or introduce
much overhead beyond that of a regular function call.

More precisely, the expression `some_value is Derived(some_value)` is always
true at runtime.

It is invalid to create a subtype of `Derived`:

```python3
from typing import NewType

UserId = NewType('UserId', int)

# Fails at runtime and does not pass type checking
class AdminUserId(UserId): pass
```

However, it is possible to create a [`NewType`](#typing.NewType) based on a ‘derived’ `NewType`:

```python3
from typing import NewType

UserId = NewType('UserId', int)

ProUserId = NewType('ProUserId', UserId)
```

and typechecking for `ProUserId` will work as expected.

See [**PEP 484**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/) for more details.

#### NOTE
Recall that the use of a type alias declares two types to be *equivalent* to
one another. Doing `type Alias = Original` will make the static type checker
treat `Alias` as being *exactly equivalent* to `Original` in all cases.
This is useful when you want to simplify complex type signatures.

In contrast, `NewType` declares one type to be a *subtype* of another.
Doing `Derived = NewType('Derived', Original)` will make the static type
checker treat `Derived` as a *subclass* of `Original`, which means a
value of type `Original` cannot be used in places where a value of type
`Derived` is expected. This is useful when you want to prevent logic
errors with minimal runtime cost.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.5.2.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.10: `NewType` is now a class rather than a function.  As a result, there is
some additional runtime cost when calling `NewType` over a regular
function.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.11: The performance of calling `NewType` has been restored to its level in
Python 3.9.

<a id="annotating-callables"></a>

## Annotating callable objects

Functions – or other [callable](../glossary.md#term-callable) objects – can be annotated using
[`collections.abc.Callable`](collections.abc.md#collections.abc.Callable) or deprecated [`typing.Callable`](#typing.Callable).
`Callable[[int], str]` signifies a function that takes a single parameter
of type [`int`](functions.md#int) and returns a [`str`](stdtypes.md#str).

For example:

```python
from collections.abc import Callable, Awaitable

def feeder(get_next_item: Callable[[], str]) -> None:
    ...  # Body

def async_query(on_success: Callable[[int], None],
                on_error: Callable[[int, Exception], None]) -> None:
    ...  # Body

async def on_update(value: str) -> None:
    ...  # Body

callback: Callable[[str], Awaitable[None]] = on_update
```

<a id="index-1"></a>

The subscription syntax must always be used with exactly two values: the
argument list and the return type.  The argument list must be a list of types,
a [`ParamSpec`](#typing.ParamSpec), [`Concatenate`](#typing.Concatenate), or an ellipsis (`...`). The return type must
be a single type.

If a literal ellipsis `...` is given as the argument list, it indicates that
a callable with any arbitrary parameter list would be acceptable:

```python
def concat(x: str, y: str) -> str:
    return x + y

x: Callable[..., str]
x = str     # OK
x = concat  # Also OK
```

`Callable` cannot express complex signatures such as functions that take a
variadic number of arguments, [overloaded functions](#overload), or
functions that have keyword-only parameters. However, these signatures can be
expressed by defining a [`Protocol`](#typing.Protocol) class with a
[`__call__()`](../reference/datamodel.md#object.__call__) method:

```python
from collections.abc import Iterable
from typing import Protocol

class Combiner(Protocol):
    def __call__(self, *vals: bytes, maxlen: int | None = None) -> list[bytes]: ...

def batch_proc(data: Iterable[bytes], cb_results: Combiner) -> bytes:
    for item in data:
        ...

def good_cb(*vals: bytes, maxlen: int | None = None) -> list[bytes]:
    ...
def bad_cb(*vals: bytes, maxitems: int | None) -> list[bytes]:
    ...

batch_proc([], good_cb)  # OK
batch_proc([], bad_cb)   # Error! Argument 2 has incompatible type because of
                         # different name and kind in the callback
```

Callables which take other callables as arguments may indicate that their
parameter types are dependent on each other using [`ParamSpec`](#typing.ParamSpec).
Additionally, if that callable adds or removes arguments from other
callables, the [`Concatenate`](#typing.Concatenate) operator may be used.  They
take the form `Callable[ParamSpecVariable, ReturnType]` and
`Callable[Concatenate[Arg1Type, Arg2Type, ..., ParamSpecVariable], ReturnType]`
respectively.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.10: `Callable` now supports [`ParamSpec`](#typing.ParamSpec) and [`Concatenate`](#typing.Concatenate).
See [**PEP 612**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0612/) for more details.

#### SEE ALSO
The documentation for [`ParamSpec`](#typing.ParamSpec) and [`Concatenate`](#typing.Concatenate) provides
examples of usage in `Callable`.

<a id="generics"></a>

## Generics

Since type information about objects kept in containers cannot be statically
inferred in a generic way, many container classes in the standard library support
subscription to denote the expected types of container elements.

```python
from collections.abc import Mapping, Sequence

class Employee: ...

# Sequence[Employee] indicates that all elements in the sequence
# must be instances of "Employee".
# Mapping[str, str] indicates that all keys and all values in the mapping
# must be strings.
def notify_by_email(employees: Sequence[Employee],
                    overrides: Mapping[str, str]) -> None: ...
```

Generic functions and classes can be parameterized by using
[type parameter syntax](../reference/compound_stmts.md#type-params):

```python3
from collections.abc import Sequence

def first[T](l: Sequence[T]) -> T:  # Function is generic over the TypeVar "T"
    return l[0]
```

Or by using the [`TypeVar`](#typing.TypeVar) factory directly:

```python3
from collections.abc import Sequence
from typing import TypeVar

U = TypeVar('U')                  # Declare type variable "U"

def second(l: Sequence[U]) -> U:  # Function is generic over the TypeVar "U"
    return l[1]
```

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.12: Syntactic support for generics is new in Python 3.12.

<a id="annotating-tuples"></a>

## Annotating tuples

For most containers in Python, the typing system assumes that all elements in
the container will be of the same type. For example:

```python3
from collections.abc import Mapping

# Type checker will infer that all elements in ``x`` are meant to be ints
x: list[int] = []

# Type checker error: ``list`` only accepts a single type argument:
y: list[int, str] = [1, 'foo']

# Type checker will infer that all keys in ``z`` are meant to be strings,
# and that all values in ``z`` are meant to be either strings or ints
z: Mapping[str, str | int] = {}
```

[`list`](stdtypes.md#list) only accepts one type argument, so a type checker would emit an
error on the `y` assignment above. Similarly,
[`Mapping`](collections.abc.md#collections.abc.Mapping) only accepts two type arguments: the first
indicates the type of the keys, and the second indicates the type of the
values.

Unlike most other Python containers, however, it is common in idiomatic Python
code for tuples to have elements which are not all of the same type. For this
reason, tuples are special-cased in Python’s typing system. [`tuple`](stdtypes.md#tuple)
accepts *any number* of type arguments:

```python3
# OK: ``x`` is assigned to a tuple of length 1 where the sole element is an int
x: tuple[int] = (5,)

# OK: ``y`` is assigned to a tuple of length 2;
# element 1 is an int, element 2 is a str
y: tuple[int, str] = (5, "foo")

# Error: the type annotation indicates a tuple of length 1,
# but ``z`` has been assigned to a tuple of length 3
z: tuple[int] = (1, 2, 3)
```

<a id="index-3"></a>

To denote a tuple which could be of *any* length, and in which all elements are
of the same type `T`, use the literal ellipsis `...`: `tuple[T, ...]`.
To denote an empty tuple, use
`tuple[()]`. Using plain `tuple` as an annotation is equivalent to using
`tuple[Any, ...]`:

```python3
x: tuple[int, ...] = (1, 2)
# These reassignments are OK: ``tuple[int, ...]`` indicates x can be of any length
x = (1, 2, 3)
x = ()
# This reassignment is an error: all elements in ``x`` must be ints
x = ("foo", "bar")

# ``y`` can only ever be assigned to an empty tuple
y: tuple[()] = ()

z: tuple = ("foo", "bar")
# These reassignments are OK: plain ``tuple`` is equivalent to ``tuple[Any, ...]``
z = (1, 2, 3)
z = ()
```

<a id="type-of-class-objects"></a>

## The type of class objects

A variable annotated with `C` may accept a value of type `C`. In
contrast, a variable annotated with `type[C]` (or deprecated
[`typing.Type[C]`](#typing.Type)) may accept values that are classes
themselves – specifically, it will accept the *class object* of `C`. For
example:

```python3
a = 3         # Has type ``int``
b = int       # Has type ``type[int]``
c = type(a)   # Also has type ``type[int]``
```

Note that `type[C]` is covariant:

```python3
class User: ...
class ProUser(User): ...
class TeamUser(User): ...

def make_new_user(user_class: type[User]) -> User:
    # ...
    return user_class()

make_new_user(User)      # OK
make_new_user(ProUser)   # Also OK: ``type[ProUser]`` is a subtype of ``type[User]``
make_new_user(TeamUser)  # Still fine
make_new_user(User())    # Error: expected ``type[User]`` but got ``User``
make_new_user(int)       # Error: ``type[int]`` is not a subtype of ``type[User]``
```

The only legal parameters for [`type`](functions.md#type) are classes, [`Any`](#typing.Any),
[type variables](#generics), and unions of any of these types.
For example:

```python3
def new_non_team_user(user_class: type[BasicUser | ProUser]): ...

new_non_team_user(BasicUser)  # OK
new_non_team_user(ProUser)    # OK
new_non_team_user(TeamUser)   # Error: ``type[TeamUser]`` is not a subtype
                              # of ``type[BasicUser | ProUser]``
new_non_team_user(User)       # Also an error
```

`type[Any]` is equivalent to [`type`](functions.md#type), which is the root of Python’s
[metaclass hierarchy](../reference/datamodel.md#metaclasses).

<a id="annotating-generators-and-coroutines"></a>

## Annotating generators and coroutines

A generator can be annotated using the generic type
[`Generator[YieldType, SendType, ReturnType]`](collections.abc.md#collections.abc.Generator).
For example:

```python3
def echo_round() -> Generator[int, float, str]:
    sent = yield 0
    while sent >= 0:
        sent = yield round(sent)
    return 'Done'
```

Note that unlike many other generic classes in the standard library,
the `SendType` of [`Generator`](collections.abc.md#collections.abc.Generator) behaves
contravariantly, not covariantly or invariantly.

The `SendType` and `ReturnType` parameters default to `None`:

```python3
def infinite_stream(start: int) -> Generator[int]:
    while True:
        yield start
        start += 1
```

It is also possible to set these types explicitly:

```python3
def infinite_stream(start: int) -> Generator[int, None, None]:
    while True:
        yield start
        start += 1
```

Simple generators that only ever yield values can also be annotated
as having a return type of either
[`Iterable[YieldType]`](collections.abc.md#collections.abc.Iterable)
or [`Iterator[YieldType]`](collections.abc.md#collections.abc.Iterator):

```python3
def infinite_stream(start: int) -> Iterator[int]:
    while True:
        yield start
        start += 1
```

Async generators are handled in a similar fashion, but don’t
expect a `ReturnType` type argument
([`AsyncGenerator[YieldType, SendType]`](collections.abc.md#collections.abc.AsyncGenerator)).
The `SendType` argument defaults to `None`, so the following definitions
are equivalent:

```python3
async def infinite_stream(start: int) -> AsyncGenerator[int]:
    while True:
        yield start
        start = await increment(start)

async def infinite_stream(start: int) -> AsyncGenerator[int, None]:
    while True:
        yield start
        start = await increment(start)
```

As in the synchronous case,
[`AsyncIterable[YieldType]`](collections.abc.md#collections.abc.AsyncIterable)
and [`AsyncIterator[YieldType]`](collections.abc.md#collections.abc.AsyncIterator) are
available as well:

```python3
async def infinite_stream(start: int) -> AsyncIterator[int]:
    while True:
        yield start
        start = await increment(start)
```

Coroutines can be annotated using
[`Coroutine[YieldType, SendType, ReturnType]`](collections.abc.md#collections.abc.Coroutine).
Generic arguments correspond to those of [`Generator`](collections.abc.md#collections.abc.Generator),
for example:

```python3
from collections.abc import Coroutine
c: Coroutine[list[str], str, int]  # Some coroutine defined elsewhere
x = c.send('hi')                   # Inferred type of 'x' is list[str]
async def bar() -> None:
    y = await c                    # Inferred type of 'y' is int
```

<a id="user-defined-generics"></a>

## User-defined generic types

A user-defined class can be defined as a generic class.

```python3
from logging import Logger

class LoggedVar[T]:
    def __init__(self, value: T, name: str, logger: Logger) -> None:
        self.name = name
        self.logger = logger
        self.value = value

    def set(self, new: T) -> None:
        self.log('Set ' + repr(self.value))
        self.value = new

    def get(self) -> T:
        self.log('Get ' + repr(self.value))
        return self.value

    def log(self, message: str) -> None:
        self.logger.info('%s: %s', self.name, message)
```

This syntax indicates that the class `LoggedVar` is parameterised around a
single [type variable](#typevar) `T` . This also makes `T` valid as
a type within the class body.

Generic classes implicitly inherit from [`Generic`](#typing.Generic). For compatibility
with Python 3.11 and lower, it is also possible to inherit explicitly from
[`Generic`](#typing.Generic) to indicate a generic class:

```python3
from typing import TypeVar, Generic

T = TypeVar('T')

class LoggedVar(Generic[T]):
    ...
```

Generic classes have [`__class_getitem__()`](../reference/datamodel.md#object.__class_getitem__) methods, meaning they
can be parameterised at runtime (e.g. `LoggedVar[int]` below):

```python3
from collections.abc import Iterable

def zero_all_vars(vars: Iterable[LoggedVar[int]]) -> None:
    for var in vars:
        var.set(0)
```

A generic type can have any number of type variables. All varieties of
[`TypeVar`](#typing.TypeVar) are permissible as parameters for a generic type:

```python3
from typing import TypeVar, Generic, Sequence

class WeirdTrio[T, B: Sequence[bytes], S: (int, str)]:
    ...

OldT = TypeVar('OldT', contravariant=True)
OldB = TypeVar('OldB', bound=Sequence[bytes], covariant=True)
OldS = TypeVar('OldS', int, str)

class OldWeirdTrio(Generic[OldT, OldB, OldS]):
    ...
```

Each type variable argument to [`Generic`](#typing.Generic) must be distinct.
This is thus invalid:

```python3
from typing import TypeVar, Generic
...

class Pair[M, M]:  # SyntaxError
    ...

T = TypeVar('T')

class Pair(Generic[T, T]):   # INVALID
    ...
```

Generic classes can also inherit from other classes:

```python3
from collections.abc import Sized

class LinkedList[T](Sized):
    ...
```

When inheriting from generic classes, some type parameters could be fixed:

```python3
from collections.abc import Mapping

class MyDict[T](Mapping[str, T]):
    ...
```

In this case `MyDict` has a single parameter, `T`.

Using a generic class without specifying type parameters assumes
[`Any`](#typing.Any) for each position. In the following example, `MyIterable` is
not generic but implicitly inherits from `Iterable[Any]`:

```python
from collections.abc import Iterable

class MyIterable(Iterable): # Same as Iterable[Any]
    ...
```

User-defined generic type aliases are also supported. Examples:

```python3
from collections.abc import Iterable

type Response[S] = Iterable[S] | int

# Return type here is same as Iterable[str] | int
def response(query: str) -> Response[str]:
    ...

type Vec[T] = Iterable[tuple[T, T]]

def inproduct[T: (int, float, complex)](v: Vec[T]) -> T: # Same as Iterable[tuple[T, T]]
    return sum(x*y for x, y in v)
```

For backward compatibility, generic type aliases can also be created
through a simple assignment:

```python3
from collections.abc import Iterable
from typing import TypeVar

S = TypeVar("S")
Response = Iterable[S] | int
```

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.7: [`Generic`](#typing.Generic) no longer has a custom metaclass.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.12: Syntactic support for generics and type aliases is new in version 3.12.
Previously, generic classes had to explicitly inherit from [`Generic`](#typing.Generic)
or contain a type variable in one of their bases.

User-defined generics for parameter expressions are also supported via parameter
specification variables in the form `[**P]`.  The behavior is consistent
with type variables’ described above as parameter specification variables are
treated by the `typing` module as a specialized type variable.  The one exception
to this is that a list of types can be used to substitute a [`ParamSpec`](#typing.ParamSpec):

```python3
>>> class Z[T, **P]: ...  # T is a TypeVar; P is a ParamSpec
...
>>> Z[int, [dict, float]]
__main__.Z[int, [dict, float]]
```

Classes generic over a [`ParamSpec`](#typing.ParamSpec) can also be created using explicit
inheritance from [`Generic`](#typing.Generic). In this case, `**` is not used:

```python3
from typing import ParamSpec, Generic

P = ParamSpec('P')

class Z(Generic[P]):
    ...
```

Another difference between [`TypeVar`](#typing.TypeVar) and [`ParamSpec`](#typing.ParamSpec) is that a
generic with only one parameter specification variable will accept
parameter lists in the forms `X[[Type1, Type2, ...]]` and also
`X[Type1, Type2, ...]` for aesthetic reasons.  Internally, the latter is converted
to the former, so the following are equivalent:

```python3
>>> class X[**P]: ...
...
>>> X[int, str]
__main__.X[[int, str]]
>>> X[[int, str]]
__main__.X[[int, str]]
```

Note that generics with [`ParamSpec`](#typing.ParamSpec) may not have correct
`__parameters__` after substitution in some cases because they
are intended primarily for static type checking.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.10: [`Generic`](#typing.Generic) can now be parameterized over parameter expressions.
See [`ParamSpec`](#typing.ParamSpec) and [**PEP 612**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0612/) for more details.

A user-defined generic class can have ABCs as base classes without a metaclass
conflict. Generic metaclasses are not supported. The outcome of parameterizing
generics is cached, and most types in the `typing` module are [hashable](../glossary.md#term-hashable) and
comparable for equality.

## The [`Any`](#typing.Any) type

A special kind of type is [`Any`](#typing.Any). A static type checker will treat
every type as being compatible with [`Any`](#typing.Any) and [`Any`](#typing.Any) as being
compatible with every type.

This means that it is possible to perform any operation or method call on a
value of type [`Any`](#typing.Any) and assign it to any variable:

```python3
from typing import Any

a: Any = None
a = []          # OK
a = 2           # OK

s: str = ''
s = a           # OK

def foo(item: Any) -> int:
    # Passes type checking; 'item' could be any type,
    # and that type might have a 'bar' method
    item.bar()
    ...
```

Notice that no type checking is performed when assigning a value of type
[`Any`](#typing.Any) to a more precise type. For example, the static type checker did
not report an error when assigning `a` to `s` even though `s` was
declared to be of type [`str`](stdtypes.md#str) and receives an [`int`](functions.md#int) value at
runtime!

Furthermore, all functions without a return type or parameter types will
implicitly default to using [`Any`](#typing.Any):

```python3
def legacy_parser(text):
    ...
    return data

# A static type checker will treat the above
# as having the same signature as:
def legacy_parser(text: Any) -> Any:
    ...
    return data
```

This behavior allows [`Any`](#typing.Any) to be used as an *escape hatch* when you
need to mix dynamically and statically typed code.

Contrast the behavior of [`Any`](#typing.Any) with the behavior of [`object`](functions.md#object).
Similar to [`Any`](#typing.Any), every type is a subtype of [`object`](functions.md#object). However,
unlike [`Any`](#typing.Any), the reverse is not true: [`object`](functions.md#object) is *not* a
subtype of every other type.

That means when the type of a value is [`object`](functions.md#object), a type checker will
reject almost all operations on it, and assigning it to a variable (or using
it as a return value) of a more specialized type is a type error. For example:

```python3
def hash_a(item: object) -> int:
    # Fails type checking; an object does not have a 'magic' method.
    item.magic()
    ...

def hash_b(item: Any) -> int:
    # Passes type checking
    item.magic()
    ...

# Passes type checking, since ints and strs are subclasses of object
hash_a(42)
hash_a("foo")

# Passes type checking, since Any is compatible with all types
hash_b(42)
hash_b("foo")
```

Use [`object`](functions.md#object) to indicate that a value could be any type in a typesafe
manner. Use [`Any`](#typing.Any) to indicate that a value is dynamically typed.

## Nominal vs structural subtyping

Initially [**PEP 484**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/) defined the Python static type system as using
*nominal subtyping*. This means that a class `A` is allowed where
a class `B` is expected if and only if `A` is a subclass of `B`.

This requirement previously also applied to abstract base classes, such as
[`Iterable`](collections.abc.md#collections.abc.Iterable). The problem with this approach is that a class had
to be explicitly marked to support them, which is unpythonic and unlike
what one would normally do in idiomatic dynamically typed Python code.
For example, this conforms to [**PEP 484**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/):

```python3
from collections.abc import Sized, Iterable, Iterator

class Bucket(Sized, Iterable[int]):
    ...
    def __len__(self) -> int: ...
    def __iter__(self) -> Iterator[int]: ...
```

[**PEP 544**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0544/) solves this problem by allowing users to write
the above code without explicit base classes in the class definition,
allowing `Bucket` to be implicitly considered a subtype of both `Sized`
and `Iterable[int]` by static type checkers. This is known as
*structural subtyping* (or static duck-typing):

```python3
from collections.abc import Iterator, Iterable

class Bucket:  # Note: no base classes
    ...
    def __len__(self) -> int: ...
    def __iter__(self) -> Iterator[int]: ...

def collect(items: Iterable[int]) -> int: ...
result = collect(Bucket())  # Passes type check
```

Moreover, by subclassing a special class [`Protocol`](#typing.Protocol), a user
can define new custom protocols to fully enjoy structural subtyping
(see examples below).

## Module contents

The `typing` module defines the following classes, functions and decorators.

### Special typing primitives

#### Special types

These can be used as types in annotations. They do not support subscription
using `[]`.

### typing.Any

Special type indicating an unconstrained type.

* Every type is compatible with [`Any`](#typing.Any).
* [`Any`](#typing.Any) is compatible with every type.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.11: [`Any`](#typing.Any) can now be used as a base class. This can be useful for
avoiding type checker errors with classes that can duck type anywhere or
are highly dynamic.

### typing.AnyStr

A [constrained type variable](#typing-constrained-typevar).

Definition:

```python3
AnyStr = TypeVar('AnyStr', str, bytes)
```

`AnyStr` is meant to be used for functions that may accept [`str`](stdtypes.md#str) or
[`bytes`](stdtypes.md#bytes) arguments but cannot allow the two to mix.

For example:

```python3
def concat(a: AnyStr, b: AnyStr) -> AnyStr:
    return a + b

concat("foo", "bar")    # OK, output has type 'str'
concat(b"foo", b"bar")  # OK, output has type 'bytes'
concat("foo", b"bar")   # Error, cannot mix str and bytes
```

Note that, despite its name, `AnyStr` has nothing to do with the
[`Any`](#typing.Any) type, nor does it mean “any string”. In particular, `AnyStr`
and `str | bytes` are different from each other and have different use
cases:

```python3
# Invalid use of AnyStr:
# The type variable is used only once in the function signature,
# so cannot be "solved" by the type checker
def greet_bad(cond: bool) -> AnyStr:
    return "hi there!" if cond else b"greetings!"

# The better way of annotating this function:
def greet_proper(cond: bool) -> str | bytes:
    return "hi there!" if cond else b"greetings!"
```

#### Deprecated-removed
Deprecated since version 3.13, will be removed in version 3.18: Deprecated in favor of the new [type parameter syntax](../reference/compound_stmts.md#type-params).
Use `class A[T: (str, bytes)]: ...` instead of importing `AnyStr`. See
[**PEP 695**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/) for more details.

In Python 3.16, `AnyStr` will be removed from `typing.__all__`, and
deprecation warnings will be emitted at runtime when it is accessed or
imported from `typing`. `AnyStr` will be removed from `typing`
in Python 3.18.

### typing.LiteralString

Special type that includes only literal strings.

Any string
literal is compatible with `LiteralString`, as is another
`LiteralString`. However, an object typed as just `str` is not.
A string created by composing `LiteralString`-typed objects
is also acceptable as a `LiteralString`.

Example:

```python
def run_query(sql: LiteralString) -> None:
    ...

def caller(arbitrary_string: str, literal_string: LiteralString) -> None:
    run_query("SELECT * FROM students")  # OK
    run_query(literal_string)  # OK
    run_query("SELECT * FROM " + literal_string)  # OK
    run_query(arbitrary_string)  # type checker error
    run_query(  # type checker error
        f"SELECT * FROM students WHERE name = {arbitrary_string}"
    )
```

`LiteralString` is useful for sensitive APIs where arbitrary user-generated
strings could generate problems. For example, the two cases above
that generate type checker errors could be vulnerable to an SQL
injection attack.

See [**PEP 675**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0675/) for more details.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.11.

### typing.Never

### typing.NoReturn

`Never` and `NoReturn` represent the
[bottom type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom_type),
a type that has no members.

They can be used to indicate that a function never returns,
such as [`sys.exit()`](sys.md#sys.exit):

```python3
from typing import Never  # or NoReturn

def stop() -> Never:
    raise RuntimeError('no way')
```

Or to define a function that should never be
called, as there are no valid arguments, such as
[`assert_never()`](#typing.assert_never):

```python3
from typing import Never  # or NoReturn

def never_call_me(arg: Never) -> None:
    pass

def int_or_str(arg: int | str) -> None:
    never_call_me(arg)  # type checker error
    match arg:
        case int():
            print("It's an int")
        case str():
            print("It's a str")
        case _:
            never_call_me(arg)  # OK, arg is of type Never (or NoReturn)
```

`Never` and `NoReturn` have the same meaning in the type system
and static type checkers treat both equivalently.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.6.2: Added [`NoReturn`](#typing.NoReturn).

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.11: Added [`Never`](#typing.Never).

### typing.Self

Special type to represent the current enclosed class.

For example:

```python3
from typing import Self, reveal_type

class Foo:
    def return_self(self) -> Self:
        ...
        return self

class SubclassOfFoo(Foo): pass

reveal_type(Foo().return_self())  # Revealed type is "Foo"
reveal_type(SubclassOfFoo().return_self())  # Revealed type is "SubclassOfFoo"
```

This annotation is semantically equivalent to the following,
albeit in a more succinct fashion:

```python3
from typing import TypeVar

Self = TypeVar("Self", bound="Foo")

class Foo:
    def return_self(self: Self) -> Self:
        ...
        return self
```

In general, if something returns `self`, as in the above examples, you
should use `Self` as the return annotation. If `Foo.return_self` was
annotated as returning `"Foo"`, then the type checker would infer the
object returned from `SubclassOfFoo.return_self` as being of type `Foo`
rather than `SubclassOfFoo`.

Other common use cases include:

- [`classmethod`](functions.md#classmethod)s that are used as alternative constructors and return instances
  of the `cls` parameter.
- Annotating an [`__enter__()`](../reference/datamodel.md#object.__enter__) method which returns self.

You should not use `Self` as the return annotation if the method is not
guaranteed to return an instance of a subclass when the class is
subclassed:

```python3
class Eggs:
    # Self would be an incorrect return annotation here,
    # as the object returned is always an instance of Eggs,
    # even in subclasses
    def returns_eggs(self) -> "Eggs":
        return Eggs()
```

See [**PEP 673**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0673/) for more details.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.11.

### typing.TypeAlias

Special annotation for explicitly declaring a [type alias](#type-aliases).

For example:

```python3
from typing import TypeAlias

Factors: TypeAlias = list[int]
```

`TypeAlias` is particularly useful on older Python versions for annotating
aliases that make use of forward references, as it can be hard for type
checkers to distinguish these from normal variable assignments:

```python
from typing import Generic, TypeAlias, TypeVar

T = TypeVar("T")

# "Box" does not exist yet,
# so we have to use quotes for the forward reference on Python <3.12.
# Using ``TypeAlias`` tells the type checker that this is a type alias declaration,
# not a variable assignment to a string.
BoxOfStrings: TypeAlias = "Box[str]"

class Box(Generic[T]):
    @classmethod
    def make_box_of_strings(cls) -> BoxOfStrings: ...
```

See [**PEP 613**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0613/) for more details.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.10.

#### Deprecated
Deprecated since version 3.12: [`TypeAlias`](#typing.TypeAlias) is deprecated in favor of the [`type`](../reference/simple_stmts.md#type) statement,
which creates instances of [`TypeAliasType`](#typing.TypeAliasType)
and which natively supports forward references.
Note that while [`TypeAlias`](#typing.TypeAlias) and [`TypeAliasType`](#typing.TypeAliasType) serve
similar purposes and have similar names, they are distinct and the
latter is not the type of the former.
Removal of [`TypeAlias`](#typing.TypeAlias) is not currently planned, but users
are encouraged to migrate to [`type`](../reference/simple_stmts.md#type) statements.

#### Special forms

These can be used as types in annotations. They all support subscription using
`[]`, but each has a unique syntax.

### *class* typing.Union

Union type; `Union[X, Y]` is equivalent to `X | Y` and means either X or Y.

To define a union, use e.g. `Union[int, str]` or the shorthand `int | str`. Using that shorthand is recommended. Details:

* The arguments must be types and there must be at least one.
* Unions of unions are flattened, e.g.:
  ```python3
  Union[Union[int, str], float] == Union[int, str, float]
  ```

  However, this does not apply to unions referenced through a type
  alias, to avoid forcing evaluation of the underlying [`TypeAliasType`](#typing.TypeAliasType):
  ```python3
  type A = Union[int, str]
  Union[A, float] != Union[int, str, float]
  ```
* Unions of a single argument vanish, e.g.:
  ```python3
  Union[int] == int  # The constructor actually returns int
  ```
* Redundant arguments are skipped, e.g.:
  ```python3
  Union[int, str, int] == Union[int, str] == int | str
  ```
* When comparing unions, the argument order is ignored, e.g.:
  ```python3
  Union[int, str] == Union[str, int]
  ```
* You cannot subclass or instantiate a `Union`.
* You cannot write `Union[X][Y]`.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.7: Don’t remove explicit subclasses from unions at runtime.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.10: Unions can now be written as `X | Y`. See
[union type expressions](stdtypes.md#types-union).

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.14: [`types.UnionType`](types.md#types.UnionType) is now an alias for [`Union`](#typing.Union), and both
`Union[int, str]` and `int | str` create instances of the same class.
To check whether an object is a `Union` at runtime, use
`isinstance(obj, Union)`. For compatibility with earlier versions of
Python, use
`get_origin(obj) is typing.Union or get_origin(obj) is types.UnionType`.

### typing.Optional

`Optional[X]` is equivalent to `X | None` (or `Union[X, None]`).

Note that this is not the same concept as an optional argument,
which is one that has a default.  An optional argument with a
default does not require the `Optional` qualifier on its type
annotation just because it is optional. For example:

```python3
def foo(arg: int = 0) -> None:
    ...
```

On the other hand, if an explicit value of `None` is allowed, the
use of `Optional` is appropriate, whether the argument is optional
or not. For example:

```python3
def foo(arg: Optional[int] = None) -> None:
    ...
```

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.10: Optional can now be written as `X | None`. See
[union type expressions](stdtypes.md#types-union).

### typing.Concatenate

Special form for annotating higher-order functions.

<a id="index-12"></a>

`Concatenate` can be used in conjunction with [Callable](#annotating-callables) and
[`ParamSpec`](#typing.ParamSpec) to annotate a higher-order callable which adds, removes,
or transforms parameters of another
callable.  Usage is in the form
`Concatenate[Arg1Type, Arg2Type, ..., ParamSpecVariable]`. `Concatenate`
is valid when used in [Callable](#annotating-callables) type hints
and when instantiating user-defined generic classes with [`ParamSpec`](#typing.ParamSpec) parameters.
The last parameter to `Concatenate` must be a [`ParamSpec`](#typing.ParamSpec) or
ellipsis (`...`).

For example, to annotate a decorator `with_lock` which provides a
[`threading.Lock`](threading.md#threading.Lock) to the decorated function,  `Concatenate` can be
used to indicate that `with_lock` expects a callable which takes in a
`Lock` as the first argument, and returns a callable with a different type
signature.  In this case, the [`ParamSpec`](#typing.ParamSpec) indicates that the returned
callable’s parameter types are dependent on the parameter types of the
callable being passed in:

```python3
from collections.abc import Callable
from threading import Lock
from typing import Concatenate

# Use this lock to ensure that only one thread is executing a function
# at any time.
my_lock = Lock()

def with_lock[**P, R](f: Callable[Concatenate[Lock, P], R]) -> Callable[P, R]:
    '''A type-safe decorator which provides a lock.'''
    def inner(*args: P.args, **kwargs: P.kwargs) -> R:
        # Provide the lock as the first argument.
        return f(my_lock, *args, **kwargs)
    return inner

@with_lock
def sum_threadsafe(lock: Lock, numbers: list[float]) -> float:
    '''Add a list of numbers together in a thread-safe manner.'''
    with lock:
        return sum(numbers)

# We don't need to pass in the lock ourselves thanks to the decorator.
sum_threadsafe([1.1, 2.2, 3.3])
```

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.10.

#### SEE ALSO
* [**PEP 612**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0612/) – Parameter Specification Variables (the PEP which introduced
  `ParamSpec` and `Concatenate`)
* [`ParamSpec`](#typing.ParamSpec)
* [Annotating callable objects](#annotating-callables)

### typing.Literal

Special typing form to define “literal types”.

`Literal` can be used to indicate to type checkers that the
annotated object has a value equivalent to one of the
provided literals.

For example:

```python3
def validate_simple(data: Any) -> Literal[True]:  # always returns True
    ...

type Mode = Literal['r', 'rb', 'w', 'wb']
def open_helper(file: str, mode: Mode) -> str:
    ...

open_helper('/some/path', 'r')      # Passes type check
open_helper('/other/path', 'typo')  # Error in type checker
```

`Literal[...]` cannot be subclassed. At runtime, an arbitrary value
is allowed as type argument to `Literal[...]`, but type checkers may
impose restrictions. See [**PEP 586**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0586/) for more details about literal types.

Additional details:

* The arguments must be literal values and there must be at least one.
* Nested `Literal` types are flattened, e.g.:
  ```python3
  assert Literal[Literal[1, 2], 3] == Literal[1, 2, 3]
  ```

  However, this does not apply to `Literal` types referenced through a type
  alias, to avoid forcing evaluation of the underlying [`TypeAliasType`](#typing.TypeAliasType):
  ```python3
  type A = Literal[1, 2]
  assert Literal[A, 3] != Literal[1, 2, 3]
  ```
* Redundant arguments are skipped, e.g.:
  ```python3
  assert Literal[1, 2, 1] == Literal[1, 2]
  ```
* When comparing literals, the argument order is ignored, e.g.:
  ```python3
  assert Literal[1, 2] == Literal[2, 1]
  ```
* You cannot subclass or instantiate a `Literal`.
* You cannot write `Literal[X][Y]`.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.8.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.9.1: `Literal` now de-duplicates parameters.  Equality comparisons of
`Literal` objects are no longer order dependent. `Literal` objects
will now raise a [`TypeError`](exceptions.md#TypeError) exception during equality comparisons
if one of their parameters are not [hashable](../glossary.md#term-hashable).

### typing.ClassVar

Special type construct to mark class variables.

As introduced in [**PEP 526**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0526/), a variable annotation wrapped in ClassVar
indicates that a given attribute is intended to be used as a class variable
and should not be set on instances of that class. Usage:

```python3
class Starship:
    stats: ClassVar[dict[str, int]] = {} # class variable
    damage: int = 10                     # instance variable
```

[`ClassVar`](#typing.ClassVar) accepts only types and cannot be further subscribed.

[`ClassVar`](#typing.ClassVar) is not a class itself, and should not
be used with [`isinstance()`](functions.md#isinstance) or [`issubclass()`](functions.md#issubclass).
[`ClassVar`](#typing.ClassVar) does not change Python runtime behavior, but
it can be used by third-party type checkers. For example, a type checker
might flag the following code as an error:

```python3
enterprise_d = Starship(3000)
enterprise_d.stats = {} # Error, setting class variable on instance
Starship.stats = {}     # This is OK
```

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.5.3.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.13: [`ClassVar`](#typing.ClassVar) can now be nested in [`Final`](#typing.Final) and vice versa.

### typing.Final

Special typing construct to indicate final names to type checkers.

Final names cannot be reassigned in any scope. Final names declared in class
scopes cannot be overridden in subclasses.

For example:

```python3
MAX_SIZE: Final = 9000
MAX_SIZE += 1  # Error reported by type checker

class Connection:
    TIMEOUT: Final[int] = 10

class FastConnector(Connection):
    TIMEOUT = 1  # Error reported by type checker
```

There is no runtime checking of these properties. See [**PEP 591**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0591/) for
more details.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.8.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.13: [`Final`](#typing.Final) can now be nested in [`ClassVar`](#typing.ClassVar) and vice versa.

### typing.Required

Special typing construct to mark a [`TypedDict`](#typing.TypedDict) key as required.

This is mainly useful for `total=False` TypedDicts. See [`TypedDict`](#typing.TypedDict)
and [**PEP 655**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0655/) for more details.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.11.

### typing.NotRequired

Special typing construct to mark a [`TypedDict`](#typing.TypedDict) key as potentially
missing.

See [`TypedDict`](#typing.TypedDict) and [**PEP 655**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0655/) for more details.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.11.

### typing.ReadOnly

A special typing construct to mark an item of a [`TypedDict`](#typing.TypedDict) as read-only.

For example:

```python3
class Movie(TypedDict):
   title: ReadOnly[str]
   year: int

def mutate_movie(m: Movie) -> None:
   m["year"] = 1999  # allowed
   m["title"] = "The Matrix"  # typechecker error
```

There is no runtime checking for this property.

See [`TypedDict`](#typing.TypedDict) and [**PEP 705**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0705/) for more details.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.13.

### typing.Annotated

Special typing form to add context-specific metadata to an annotation.

Add metadata `x` to a given type `T` by using the annotation
`Annotated[T, x]`. Metadata added using `Annotated` can be used by
static analysis tools or at runtime. At runtime, the metadata is stored
in a `__metadata__` attribute.

If a library or tool encounters an annotation `Annotated[T, x]` and has
no special logic for the metadata, it should ignore the metadata and simply
treat the annotation as `T`. As such, `Annotated` can be useful for code
that wants to use annotations for purposes outside Python’s static typing
system.

Using `Annotated[T, x]` as an annotation still allows for static
typechecking of `T`, as type checkers will simply ignore the metadata `x`.
In this way, `Annotated` differs from the
[`@no_type_check`](#typing.no_type_check) decorator, which can also be used for
adding annotations outside the scope of the typing system, but
completely disables typechecking for a function or class.

The responsibility of how to interpret the metadata
lies with the tool or library encountering an
`Annotated` annotation. A tool or library encountering an `Annotated` type
can scan through the metadata elements to determine if they are of interest
(e.g., using [`isinstance()`](functions.md#isinstance)).

### Annotated[<type>, <metadata>]

Here is an example of how you might use `Annotated` to add metadata to
type annotations if you were doing range analysis:

```python
@dataclass
class ValueRange:
    lo: int
    hi: int

T1 = Annotated[int, ValueRange(-10, 5)]
T2 = Annotated[T1, ValueRange(-20, 3)]
```

The first argument to `Annotated` must be a valid type. Multiple metadata
elements can be supplied as `Annotated` supports variadic arguments. The
order of the metadata elements is preserved and matters for equality checks:

```python3
@dataclass
class ctype:
     kind: str

a1 = Annotated[int, ValueRange(3, 10), ctype("char")]
a2 = Annotated[int, ctype("char"), ValueRange(3, 10)]

assert a1 != a2  # Order matters
```

It is up to the tool consuming the annotations to decide whether the
client is allowed to add multiple metadata elements to one annotation and how to
merge those annotations.

Nested `Annotated` types are flattened. The order of the metadata elements
starts with the innermost annotation:

```python3
assert Annotated[Annotated[int, ValueRange(3, 10)], ctype("char")] == Annotated[
    int, ValueRange(3, 10), ctype("char")
]
```

However, this does not apply to `Annotated` types referenced through a type
alias, to avoid forcing evaluation of the underlying [`TypeAliasType`](#typing.TypeAliasType):

```python3
type From3To10[T] = Annotated[T, ValueRange(3, 10)]
assert Annotated[From3To10[int], ctype("char")] != Annotated[
   int, ValueRange(3, 10), ctype("char")
]
```

Duplicated metadata elements are not removed:

```python3
assert Annotated[int, ValueRange(3, 10)] != Annotated[
    int, ValueRange(3, 10), ValueRange(3, 10)
]
```

`Annotated` can be used with nested and generic aliases:

> ```python
> @dataclass
> class MaxLen:
>     value: int

> type Vec[T] = Annotated[list[tuple[T, T]], MaxLen(10)]

> # When used in a type annotation, a type checker will treat "V" the same as
> # ``Annotated[list[tuple[int, int]], MaxLen(10)]``:
> type V = Vec[int]
> ```

`Annotated` cannot be used with an unpacked [`TypeVarTuple`](#typing.TypeVarTuple):

```python3
type Variadic[*Ts] = Annotated[*Ts, Ann1] = Annotated[T1, T2, T3, ..., Ann1]  # NOT valid
```

where `T1`, `T2`, … are [`TypeVars`](#typing.TypeVar). This is invalid as
only one type should be passed to Annotated.

By default, [`get_type_hints()`](#typing.get_type_hints) strips the metadata from annotations.
Pass `include_extras=True` to have the metadata preserved:

> ```pycon
> >>> from typing import Annotated, get_type_hints
> >>> def func(x: Annotated[int, "metadata"]) -> None: pass
> ...
> >>> get_type_hints(func)
> {'x': <class 'int'>, 'return': <class 'NoneType'>}
> >>> get_type_hints(func, include_extras=True)
> {'x': typing.Annotated[int, 'metadata'], 'return': <class 'NoneType'>}
> ```

At runtime, the metadata associated with an `Annotated` type can be
retrieved via the `__metadata__` attribute:

> ```pycon
> >>> from typing import Annotated
> >>> X = Annotated[int, "very", "important", "metadata"]
> >>> X
> typing.Annotated[int, 'very', 'important', 'metadata']
> >>> X.__metadata__
> ('very', 'important', 'metadata')
> ```

If you want to retrieve the original type wrapped by `Annotated`, use the
`__origin__` attribute:

> ```pycon
> >>> from typing import Annotated, get_origin
> >>> Password = Annotated[str, "secret"]
> >>> Password.__origin__
> <class 'str'>
> ```

Note that using [`get_origin()`](#typing.get_origin) will return `Annotated` itself:

> ```pycon
> >>> get_origin(Password)
> typing.Annotated
> ```

Added in version 3.9.

### typing.TypeForm

A special form representing the value that results from evaluating a
type expression.

This value encodes the information supplied in the type expression, and
it represents the type described by that type expression.

When used in a type expression, `TypeForm` describes a set of type form
objects. It accepts a single type argument, which must be a valid type
expression. `TypeForm[T]` describes the set of all type form objects that
represent the type `T` or types assignable to `T`.

`TypeForm(obj)` simply returns `obj` unchanged. This is useful for
explicitly marking a value as a type form for static type checkers.

Example:

```python3
from typing import Any, TypeForm

def cast[T](typ: TypeForm[T], value: Any) -> T: ...

reveal_type(cast(int, "x"))  # Revealed type is "int"
```

See [**PEP 747**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0747/) for details.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.15.

### typing.TypeIs

Special typing construct for marking user-defined type predicate functions.

`TypeIs` can be used to annotate the return type of a user-defined
type predicate function.  `TypeIs` only accepts a single type argument.
At runtime, functions marked this way should return a boolean and take at
least one positional argument.

`TypeIs` aims to benefit *type narrowing* – a technique used by static
type checkers to determine a more precise type of an expression within a
program’s code flow.  Usually type narrowing is done by analyzing
conditional code flow and applying the narrowing to a block of code.  The
conditional expression here is sometimes referred to as a “type predicate”:

```python3
def is_str(val: str | float):
    # "isinstance" type predicate
    if isinstance(val, str):
        # Type of ``val`` is narrowed to ``str``
        ...
    else:
        # Else, type of ``val`` is narrowed to ``float``.
        ...
```

Sometimes it would be convenient to use a user-defined boolean function
as a type predicate.  Such a function should use `TypeIs[...]` or
[`TypeGuard`](#typing.TypeGuard) as its return type to alert static type checkers to
this intention.  `TypeIs` usually has more intuitive behavior than
`TypeGuard`, but it cannot be used when the input and output types
are incompatible (e.g., `list[object]` to `list[int]`) or when the
function does not return `True` for all instances of the narrowed type.

Using  `-> TypeIs[NarrowedType]` tells the static type checker that for a given
function:

1. The return value is a boolean.
2. If the return value is `True`, the type of its argument
   is the intersection of the argument’s original type and `NarrowedType`.
3. If the return value is `False`, the type of its argument
   is narrowed to exclude `NarrowedType`.

For example:

```python3
from typing import assert_type, final, TypeIs

class Parent: pass
class Child(Parent): pass
@final
class Unrelated: pass

def is_parent(val: object) -> TypeIs[Parent]:
    return isinstance(val, Parent)

def run(arg: Child | Unrelated):
    if is_parent(arg):
        # Type of ``arg`` is narrowed to the intersection
        # of ``Parent`` and ``Child``, which is equivalent to
        # ``Child``.
        assert_type(arg, Child)
    else:
        # Type of ``arg`` is narrowed to exclude ``Parent``,
        # so only ``Unrelated`` is left.
        assert_type(arg, Unrelated)
```

The type inside `TypeIs` must be consistent with the type of the
function’s argument; if it is not, static type checkers will raise
an error.  An incorrectly written `TypeIs` function can lead to
unsound behavior in the type system; it is the user’s responsibility
to write such functions in a type-safe manner.

If a `TypeIs` function is a class or instance method, then the type in
`TypeIs` maps to the type of the second parameter (after `cls` or
`self`).

In short, the form `def foo(arg: TypeA) -> TypeIs[TypeB]: ...`,
means that if `foo(arg)` returns `True`, then `arg` is an instance
of `TypeB`, and if it returns `False`, it is not an instance of `TypeB`.

`TypeIs` also works with type variables.  For more information, see
[**PEP 742**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0742/) (Narrowing types with `TypeIs`).

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.13.

### typing.TypeGuard

Special typing construct for marking user-defined type predicate functions.

Type predicate functions are user-defined functions that return whether their
argument is an instance of a particular type.
`TypeGuard` works similarly to [`TypeIs`](#typing.TypeIs), but has subtly different
effects on type checking behavior (see below).

Using  `-> TypeGuard` tells the static type checker that for a given
function:

1. The return value is a boolean.
2. If the return value is `True`, the type of its argument
   is the type inside `TypeGuard`.

`TypeGuard` also works with type variables.  See [**PEP 647**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0647/) for more details.

For example:

```python3
def is_str_list(val: list[object]) -> TypeGuard[list[str]]:
    '''Determines whether all objects in the list are strings'''
    return all(isinstance(x, str) for x in val)

def func1(val: list[object]):
    if is_str_list(val):
        # Type of ``val`` is narrowed to ``list[str]``.
        print(" ".join(val))
    else:
        # Type of ``val`` remains as ``list[object]``.
        print("Not a list of strings!")
```

`TypeIs` and `TypeGuard` differ in the following ways:

* `TypeIs` requires the narrowed type to be a subtype of the input type, while
  `TypeGuard` does not.  The main reason is to allow for things like
  narrowing `list[object]` to `list[str]` even though the latter
  is not a subtype of the former, since `list` is invariant.
* When a `TypeGuard` function returns `True`, type checkers narrow the type of the
  variable to exactly the `TypeGuard` type. When a `TypeIs` function returns `True`,
  type checkers can infer a more precise type combining the previously known type of the
  variable with the `TypeIs` type. (Technically, this is known as an intersection type.)
* When a `TypeGuard` function returns `False`, type checkers cannot narrow the type of
  the variable at all. When a `TypeIs` function returns `False`, type checkers can narrow
  the type of the variable to exclude the `TypeIs` type.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.10.

### typing.Unpack

Typing operator to conceptually mark an object as having been unpacked.

For example, using the unpack operator `*` on a
[type variable tuple](#typevartuple) is equivalent to using `Unpack`
to mark the type variable tuple as having been unpacked:

```python3
Ts = TypeVarTuple('Ts')
tup: tuple[*Ts]
# Effectively does:
tup: tuple[Unpack[Ts]]
```

In fact, `Unpack` can be used interchangeably with `*` in the context
of [`typing.TypeVarTuple`](#typing.TypeVarTuple) and
[`builtins.tuple`](stdtypes.md#tuple) types. You might see `Unpack` being used
explicitly in older versions of Python, where `*` couldn’t be used in
certain places:

```python3
# In older versions of Python, TypeVarTuple and Unpack
# are located in the `typing_extensions` backports package.
from typing_extensions import TypeVarTuple, Unpack

Ts = TypeVarTuple('Ts')
tup: tuple[*Ts]         # Syntax error on Python <= 3.10!
tup: tuple[Unpack[Ts]]  # Semantically equivalent, and backwards-compatible
```

`Unpack` can also be used along with [`typing.TypedDict`](#typing.TypedDict) for typing
`**kwargs` in a function signature:

```python3
from typing import TypedDict, Unpack

class Movie(TypedDict):
    name: str
    year: int

# This function expects two keyword arguments - `name` of type `str`
# and `year` of type `int`.
def foo(**kwargs: Unpack[Movie]): ...
```

See [**PEP 692**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0692/) for more details on using `Unpack` for `**kwargs` typing.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.11.

#### Building generic types and type aliases

The following classes should not be used directly as annotations.
Their intended purpose is to be building blocks
for creating generic types and type aliases.

These objects can be created through special syntax
([type parameter lists](../reference/compound_stmts.md#type-params) and the [`type`](../reference/simple_stmts.md#type) statement).
For compatibility with Python 3.11 and earlier, they can also be created
without the dedicated syntax, as documented below.

### *class* typing.Generic

Abstract base class for generic types.

A generic type is typically declared by adding a list of type parameters
after the class name:

```python3
class Mapping[KT, VT]:
    def __getitem__(self, key: KT) -> VT:
        ...
        # Etc.
```

Such a class implicitly inherits from `Generic`.
The runtime semantics of this syntax are discussed in the
[Language Reference](../reference/compound_stmts.md#generic-classes).

This class can then be used as follows:

```python3
def lookup_name[X, Y](mapping: Mapping[X, Y], key: X, default: Y) -> Y:
    try:
        return mapping[key]
    except KeyError:
        return default
```

Here the brackets after the function name indicate a
[generic function](../reference/compound_stmts.md#generic-functions).

For backwards compatibility, generic classes can also be
declared by explicitly inheriting from
`Generic`. In this case, the type parameters must be declared
separately:

```python3
KT = TypeVar('KT')
VT = TypeVar('VT')

class Mapping(Generic[KT, VT]):
    def __getitem__(self, key: KT) -> VT:
        ...
        # Etc.
```

<a id="typevar"></a>

### *class* typing.TypeVar(name, \*constraints, bound=None, covariant=False, contravariant=False, infer_variance=False, default=typing.NoDefault)

Type variable.

The preferred way to construct a type variable is via the dedicated syntax
for [generic functions](../reference/compound_stmts.md#generic-functions),
[generic classes](../reference/compound_stmts.md#generic-classes), and
[generic type aliases](../reference/compound_stmts.md#generic-type-aliases):

```python3
class Sequence[T]:  # T is a TypeVar
    ...
```

This syntax can also be used to create bounded and constrained type
variables:

```python3
class StrSequence[S: str]:  # S is a TypeVar with a `str` upper bound;
    ...                     # we can say that S is "bounded by `str`"


class StrOrBytesSequence[A: (str, bytes)]:  # A is a TypeVar constrained to str or bytes
    ...
```

However, if desired, reusable type variables can also be constructed manually, like so:

```python3
T = TypeVar('T')  # Can be anything
S = TypeVar('S', bound=str)  # Can be any subtype of str
A = TypeVar('A', str, bytes)  # Must be exactly str or bytes
```

Type variables exist primarily for the benefit of static type
checkers.  They serve as the parameters for generic types as well
as for generic function and type alias definitions.
See [`Generic`](#typing.Generic) for more
information on generic types.  Generic functions work as follows:

```python3
def repeat[T](x: T, n: int) -> Sequence[T]:
    """Return a list containing n references to x."""
    return [x]*n


def print_capitalized[S: str](x: S) -> S:
    """Print x capitalized, and return x."""
    print(x.capitalize())
    return x


def concatenate[A: (str, bytes)](x: A, y: A) -> A:
    """Add two strings or bytes objects together."""
    return x + y
```

Note that type variables can be *bounded*, *constrained*, or neither, but
cannot be both bounded *and* constrained.

The variance of type variables is inferred by type checkers when they are created
through the [type parameter syntax](../reference/compound_stmts.md#type-params) or when
`infer_variance=True` is passed.
Manually created type variables may be explicitly marked covariant or contravariant by passing
`covariant=True` or `contravariant=True`.
By default, manually created type variables are invariant.
See [**PEP 484**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/) and [**PEP 695**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/) for more details.

Bounded type variables and constrained type variables have different
semantics in several important ways. Using a *bounded* type variable means
that the `TypeVar` will be solved using the most specific type possible:

```python3
x = print_capitalized('a string')
reveal_type(x)  # revealed type is str

class StringSubclass(str):
    pass

y = print_capitalized(StringSubclass('another string'))
reveal_type(y)  # revealed type is StringSubclass

z = print_capitalized(45)  # error: int is not a subtype of str
```

The upper bound of a type variable can be a concrete type, abstract type
(ABC or Protocol), or even a union of types:

```python3
# Can be anything with an __abs__ method
def print_abs[T: SupportsAbs](arg: T) -> None:
    print("Absolute value:", abs(arg))

U = TypeVar('U', bound=str|bytes)  # Can be any subtype of the union str|bytes
V = TypeVar('V', bound=SupportsAbs)  # Can be anything with an __abs__ method
```

<a id="typing-constrained-typevar"></a>

Using a *constrained* type variable, however, means that the `TypeVar`
can only ever be solved as being exactly one of the constraints given:

```python3
a = concatenate('one', 'two')
reveal_type(a)  # revealed type is str

b = concatenate(StringSubclass('one'), StringSubclass('two'))
reveal_type(b)  # revealed type is str, despite StringSubclass being passed in

c = concatenate('one', b'two')  # error: type variable 'A' can be either str or bytes in a function call, but not both
```

At runtime, `isinstance(x, T)` will raise [`TypeError`](exceptions.md#TypeError).

#### \_\_name_\_

The name of the type variable.

#### \_\_covariant_\_

Whether the type var has been explicitly marked as covariant.

#### \_\_contravariant_\_

Whether the type var has been explicitly marked as contravariant.

#### \_\_infer_variance_\_

Whether the type variable’s variance should be inferred by type checkers.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.12.

#### \_\_bound_\_

The upper bound of the type variable, if any.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.12: For type variables created through [type parameter syntax](../reference/compound_stmts.md#type-params),
the bound is evaluated only when the attribute is accessed, not when
the type variable is created (see [Lazy evaluation](../reference/executionmodel.md#lazy-evaluation)).

#### evaluate_bound()

An [evaluate function](../glossary.md#term-evaluate-function) corresponding to the [`__bound__`](#typing.TypeVar.__bound__) attribute.
When called directly, this method supports only the [`VALUE`](annotationlib.md#annotationlib.Format.VALUE)
format, which is equivalent to accessing the [`__bound__`](#typing.TypeVar.__bound__) attribute directly,
but the method object can be passed to [`annotationlib.call_evaluate_function()`](annotationlib.md#annotationlib.call_evaluate_function)
to evaluate the value in a different format.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.14.

#### \_\_constraints_\_

A tuple containing the constraints of the type variable, if any.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.12: For type variables created through [type parameter syntax](../reference/compound_stmts.md#type-params),
the constraints are evaluated only when the attribute is accessed, not when
the type variable is created (see [Lazy evaluation](../reference/executionmodel.md#lazy-evaluation)).

#### evaluate_constraints()

An [evaluate function](../glossary.md#term-evaluate-function) corresponding to the [`__constraints__`](#typing.TypeVar.__constraints__) attribute.
When called directly, this method supports only the [`VALUE`](annotationlib.md#annotationlib.Format.VALUE)
format, which is equivalent to accessing the [`__constraints__`](#typing.TypeVar.__constraints__) attribute directly,
but the method object can be passed to [`annotationlib.call_evaluate_function()`](annotationlib.md#annotationlib.call_evaluate_function)
to evaluate the value in a different format.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.14.

#### \_\_default_\_

The default value of the type variable, or [`typing.NoDefault`](#typing.NoDefault) if it
has no default.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.13.

#### evaluate_default()

An [evaluate function](../glossary.md#term-evaluate-function) corresponding to the [`__default__`](#typing.TypeVar.__default__) attribute.
When called directly, this method supports only the [`VALUE`](annotationlib.md#annotationlib.Format.VALUE)
format, which is equivalent to accessing the [`__default__`](#typing.TypeVar.__default__) attribute directly,
but the method object can be passed to [`annotationlib.call_evaluate_function()`](annotationlib.md#annotationlib.call_evaluate_function)
to evaluate the value in a different format.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.14.

#### has_default()

Return whether or not the type variable has a default value. This is equivalent
to checking whether [`__default__`](#typing.TypeVar.__default__) is not the [`typing.NoDefault`](#typing.NoDefault)
singleton, except that it does not force evaluation of the
[lazily evaluated](../reference/executionmodel.md#lazy-evaluation) default value.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.13.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.12: Type variables can now be declared using the
[type parameter](../reference/compound_stmts.md#type-params) syntax introduced by [**PEP 695**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/).
The `infer_variance` parameter was added.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.13: Support for default values was added.

<a id="typevartuple"></a>

### *class* typing.TypeVarTuple(name, , bound=None, covariant=False, contravariant=False, infer_variance=False, default=typing.NoDefault)

Type variable tuple. A specialized form of [type variable](#typevar)
that enables *variadic* generics.

Type variable tuples can be declared in [type parameter lists](../reference/compound_stmts.md#type-params)
using a single asterisk (`*`) before the name:

```python3
def move_first_element_to_last[T, *Ts](tup: tuple[T, *Ts]) -> tuple[*Ts, T]:
    return (*tup[1:], tup[0])
```

Or by explicitly invoking the `TypeVarTuple` constructor:

```python3
T = TypeVar("T")
Ts = TypeVarTuple("Ts")

def move_first_element_to_last(tup: tuple[T, *Ts]) -> tuple[*Ts, T]:
    return (*tup[1:], tup[0])
```

A normal type variable enables parameterization with a single type. A type
variable tuple, in contrast, allows parameterization with an
*arbitrary* number of types by acting like an *arbitrary* number of type
variables wrapped in a tuple. For example:

```python3
# T is bound to int, Ts is bound to ()
# Return value is (1,), which has type tuple[int]
move_first_element_to_last(tup=(1,))

# T is bound to int, Ts is bound to (str,)
# Return value is ('spam', 1), which has type tuple[str, int]
move_first_element_to_last(tup=(1, 'spam'))

# T is bound to int, Ts is bound to (str, float)
# Return value is ('spam', 3.0, 1), which has type tuple[str, float, int]
move_first_element_to_last(tup=(1, 'spam', 3.0))

# This fails to type check (and fails at runtime)
# because tuple[()] is not compatible with tuple[T, *Ts]
# (at least one element is required)
move_first_element_to_last(tup=())
```

Note the use of the unpacking operator `*` in `tuple[T, *Ts]`.
Conceptually, you can think of `Ts` as a tuple of type variables
`(T1, T2, ...)`. `tuple[T, *Ts]` would then become
`tuple[T, *(T1, T2, ...)]`, which is equivalent to
`tuple[T, T1, T2, ...]`. (Note that in older versions of Python, you might
see this written using [`Unpack`](#typing.Unpack) instead, as
`Unpack[Ts]`.)

Type variable tuples must *always* be unpacked. This helps distinguish type
variable tuples from normal type variables:

```python3
x: Ts          # Not valid
x: tuple[Ts]   # Not valid
x: tuple[*Ts]  # The correct way to do it
```

Type variable tuples can be used in the same contexts as normal type
variables. For example, in class definitions, arguments, and return types:

```python3
class Array[*Shape]:
    def __getitem__(self, key: tuple[*Shape]) -> float: ...
    def __abs__(self) -> "Array[*Shape]": ...
    def get_shape(self) -> tuple[*Shape]: ...
```

Type variable tuples can be happily combined with normal type variables:

```python
class Array[DType, *Shape]:  # This is fine
    pass

class Array2[*Shape, DType]:  # This would also be fine
    pass

class Height: ...
class Width: ...

float_array_1d: Array[float, Height] = Array()     # Totally fine
int_array_2d: Array[int, Height, Width] = Array()  # Yup, fine too
```

However, note that at most one type variable tuple may appear in a single
list of type arguments or type parameters:

```python3
x: tuple[*Ts, *Ts]            # Not valid
class Array[*Shape, *Shape]:  # Not valid
    pass
```

Finally, an unpacked type variable tuple can be used as the type annotation
of `*args`:

```python3
def call_soon[*Ts](
    callback: Callable[[*Ts], None],
    *args: *Ts
) -> None:
    ...
    callback(*args)
```

In contrast to non-unpacked annotations of `*args` - e.g. `*args: int`,
which would specify that *all* arguments are `int` - `*args: *Ts`
enables reference to the types of the *individual* arguments in `*args`.
Here, this allows us to ensure the types of the `*args` passed
to `call_soon` match the types of the (positional) arguments of
`callback`.

See [**PEP 646**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0646/) for more details on type variable tuples.

When called directly, this method supports only the [`VALUE`](annotationlib.md#annotationlib.Format.VALUE)
format, which is equivalent to accessing the [`__default__`](#typing.TypeVarTuple.__default__) attribute directly,
but the method object can be passed to [`annotationlib.call_evaluate_function()`](annotationlib.md#annotationlib.call_evaluate_function)
to evaluate the value in a different format.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.14.

#### has_default()

Return whether or not the type variable tuple has a default value. This is equivalent

singleton, except that it does not force evaluation of the
[lazily evaluated](../reference/executionmodel.md#lazy-evaluation) default value.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.13.

Type variable tuples created with `covariant=True` or
`contravariant=True` can be used to declare covariant or contravariant
generic types.  The `bound` argument is also accepted, similar to
[`TypeVar`](#typing.TypeVar), but its actual semantics are yet to be decided.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.11.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.12: Type variable tuples can now be declared using the
[type parameter](../reference/compound_stmts.md#type-params) syntax introduced by [**PEP 695**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/).

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.13: Support for default values was added.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.15: Added support for the `bound`, `covariant`, `contravariant`, and

### *class* typing.ParamSpec(name, , bound=None, covariant=False, contravariant=False, default=typing.NoDefault)

Parameter specification variable.  A specialized version of
[type variables](#typevar).

In [type parameter lists](../reference/compound_stmts.md#type-params), parameter specifications
can be declared with two asterisks (`**`):

```python3
type IntFunc[**P] = Callable[P, int]
```

For compatibility with Python 3.11 and earlier, `ParamSpec` objects
can also be created as follows:

```python3
P = ParamSpec('P')
```

Parameter specification variables exist primarily for the benefit of static
type checkers.  They are used to forward the parameter types of one
callable to another callable – a pattern commonly found in higher order
functions and decorators.  They are only valid when used in `Concatenate`,
or as the first argument to `Callable`, or as parameters for user-defined
Generics.  See [`Generic`](#typing.Generic) for more information on generic types.

For example, to add basic logging to a function, one can create a decorator
`add_logging` to log function calls.  The parameter specification variable
tells the type checker that the callable passed into the decorator and the
new callable returned by it have inter-dependent type parameters:

```python3
from collections.abc import Callable
import logging

def add_logging[T, **P](f: Callable[P, T]) -> Callable[P, T]:
    '''A type-safe decorator to add logging to a function.'''
    def inner(*args: P.args, **kwargs: P.kwargs) -> T:
        logging.info(f'{f.__name__} was called')
        return f(*args, **kwargs)
    return inner

@add_logging
def add_two(x: float, y: float) -> float:
    '''Add two numbers together.'''
    return x + y
```

Without `ParamSpec`, the simplest way to annotate this previously was to
use a [`TypeVar`](#typing.TypeVar) with upper bound `Callable[..., Any]`.  However this
causes two problems:

1. The type checker can’t type check the `inner` function because
   `*args` and `**kwargs` have to be typed [`Any`](#typing.Any).
2. [`cast()`](#typing.cast) may be required in the body of the `add_logging`
   decorator when returning the `inner` function, or the static type
   checker must be told to ignore the `return inner`.

#### args

#### kwargs

Since `ParamSpec` captures both positional and keyword parameters,
`P.args` and `P.kwargs` can be used to split a `ParamSpec` into its
components.  `P.args` represents the tuple of positional parameters in a
given call and should only be used to annotate `*args`.  `P.kwargs`
represents the mapping of keyword parameters to their values in a given call,
and should be only be used to annotate `**kwargs`.  Both
attributes require the annotated parameter to be in scope. At runtime,
`P.args` and `P.kwargs` are instances respectively of
[`ParamSpecArgs`](#typing.ParamSpecArgs) and [`ParamSpecKwargs`](#typing.ParamSpecKwargs).

#### \_\_name_\_

The name of the parameter specification.

#### \_\_covariant_\_

Whether the parameter specification has been explicitly marked as covariant.

#### \_\_contravariant_\_

Whether the parameter specification has been explicitly marked as contravariant.

#### \_\_infer_variance_\_

Whether the parameter specification’s variance should be inferred by type checkers.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.12.

#### \_\_default_\_

The default value of the parameter specification, or [`typing.NoDefault`](#typing.NoDefault) if it
has no default.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.13.

#### evaluate_default()

An [evaluate function](../glossary.md#term-evaluate-function) corresponding to the [`__default__`](#typing.ParamSpec.__default__) attribute.
When called directly, this method supports only the [`VALUE`](annotationlib.md#annotationlib.Format.VALUE)
format, which is equivalent to accessing the [`__default__`](#typing.ParamSpec.__default__) attribute directly,
but the method object can be passed to [`annotationlib.call_evaluate_function()`](annotationlib.md#annotationlib.call_evaluate_function)
to evaluate the value in a different format.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.14.

#### has_default()

Return whether or not the parameter specification has a default value. This is equivalent
to checking whether [`__default__`](#typing.ParamSpec.__default__) is not the [`typing.NoDefault`](#typing.NoDefault)
singleton, except that it does not force evaluation of the
[lazily evaluated](../reference/executionmodel.md#lazy-evaluation) default value.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.13.

Parameter specification variables created with `covariant=True` or
`contravariant=True` can be used to declare covariant or contravariant
generic types.  The `bound` argument is also accepted, similar to
[`TypeVar`](#typing.TypeVar).  However the actual semantics of these keywords are yet to
be decided.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.10.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.12: Parameter specifications can now be declared using the
[type parameter](../reference/compound_stmts.md#type-params) syntax introduced by [**PEP 695**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/).

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.13: Support for default values was added.

#### NOTE
Only parameter specification variables defined in global scope can
be pickled.

### typing.ParamSpecArgs

### typing.ParamSpecKwargs

Arguments and keyword arguments attributes of a [`ParamSpec`](#typing.ParamSpec). The
`P.args` attribute of a `ParamSpec` is an instance of `ParamSpecArgs`,
and `P.kwargs` is an instance of `ParamSpecKwargs`. They are intended
for runtime introspection and have no special meaning to static type checkers.

Calling [`get_origin()`](#typing.get_origin) on either of these objects will return the
original `ParamSpec`:

```pycon
>>> from typing import ParamSpec, get_origin
>>> P = ParamSpec("P")
>>> get_origin(P.args) is P
True
>>> get_origin(P.kwargs) is P
True
```

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.10.

### *class* typing.TypeAliasType(name, value, , type_params=(), qualname=None)

The type of type aliases created through the [`type`](../reference/simple_stmts.md#type) statement.

Example:

```pycon
>>> type Alias = int
>>> type(Alias)
<class 'typing.TypeAliasType'>
```

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.12.

#### \_\_name_\_

The name of the type alias:

```pycon
>>> type Alias = int
>>> Alias.__name__
'Alias'
```

#### \_\_qualname_\_

The [qualified name](../glossary.md#term-qualified-name) of the type alias:

```pycon
>>> class Class:
...     type Alias = int
...
>>> Class.Alias.__qualname__
'Class.Alias'
```

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.15.

#### \_\_module_\_

The name of the module in which the type alias was defined:

```python3
>>> type Alias = int
>>> Alias.__module__
'__main__'
```

#### \_\_type_params_\_

The type parameters of the type alias, or an empty tuple if the alias is
not generic:

```pycon
>>> type ListOrSet[T] = list[T] | set[T]
>>> ListOrSet.__type_params__
(T,)
>>> type NotGeneric = int
>>> NotGeneric.__type_params__
()
```

#### \_\_value_\_

The type alias’s value. This is [lazily evaluated](../reference/executionmodel.md#lazy-evaluation),
so names used in the definition of the alias are not resolved until the
`__value__` attribute is accessed:

```pycon
>>> type Mutually = Recursive
>>> type Recursive = Mutually
>>> Mutually
Mutually
>>> Recursive
Recursive
>>> Mutually.__value__
Recursive
>>> Recursive.__value__
Mutually
```

#### evaluate_value()

An [evaluate function](../glossary.md#term-evaluate-function) corresponding to the [`__value__`](#typing.TypeAliasType.__value__) attribute.
When called directly, this method supports only the [`VALUE`](annotationlib.md#annotationlib.Format.VALUE)
format, which is equivalent to accessing the [`__value__`](#typing.TypeAliasType.__value__) attribute directly,
but the method object can be passed to [`annotationlib.call_evaluate_function()`](annotationlib.md#annotationlib.call_evaluate_function)
to evaluate the value in a different format:

```pycon
>>> type Alias = undefined
>>> Alias.__value__
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NameError: name 'undefined' is not defined
>>> from annotationlib import Format, call_evaluate_function
>>> Alias.evaluate_value(Format.VALUE)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NameError: name 'undefined' is not defined
>>> call_evaluate_function(Alias.evaluate_value, Format.FORWARDREF)
ForwardRef('undefined')
```

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.14.

### Unpacking

Type aliases support star unpacking using the `*Alias` syntax.
This is equivalent to using `Unpack[Alias]` directly:

```pycon
>>> type Alias = tuple[int, str]
>>> type Unpacked = tuple[bool, *Alias]
>>> Unpacked.__value__
tuple[bool, typing.Unpack[Alias]]
```

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.14.

#### Other special directives

These functions and classes should not be used directly as annotations.
Their intended purpose is to be building blocks for creating and declaring
types.

### *class* typing.NamedTuple

Typed version of [`collections.namedtuple()`](collections.md#collections.namedtuple).

Usage:

```python3
class Employee(NamedTuple):
    name: str
    id: int
```

This is equivalent to:

```python3
Employee = collections.namedtuple('Employee', ['name', 'id'])
```

To give a field a default value, you can assign to it in the class body:

```python3
class Employee(NamedTuple):
    name: str
    id: int = 3

employee = Employee('Guido')
assert employee.id == 3
```

Fields with a default value must come after any fields without a default.

The resulting class has an extra attribute `__annotations__` giving a
dict that maps the field names to the field types.  (The field names are in
the `_fields` attribute and the default values are in the
`_field_defaults` attribute, both of which are part of the [`namedtuple()`](collections.md#collections.namedtuple)
API.)

`NamedTuple` subclasses can also have docstrings and methods:

```python3
class Employee(NamedTuple):
    """Represents an employee."""
    name: str
    id: int = 3

    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        return f'<Employee {self.name}, id={self.id}>'
```

`NamedTuple` subclasses can be generic:

```python3
class Group[T](NamedTuple):
    key: T
    group: list[T]
```

Backward-compatible usage:

```python3
# For creating a generic NamedTuple on Python 3.11
T = TypeVar("T")

class Group(NamedTuple, Generic[T]):
    key: T
    group: list[T]

# A functional syntax is also supported
Employee = NamedTuple('Employee', [('name', str), ('id', int)])
```

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.6: Added support for [**PEP 526**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0526/) variable annotation syntax.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.6.1: Added support for default values, methods, and docstrings.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.8: The `_field_types` and `__annotations__` attributes are
now regular dictionaries instead of instances of `OrderedDict`.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.9: Removed the `_field_types` attribute in favor of the more
standard `__annotations__` attribute which has the same information.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.9: `NamedTuple` is now a function rather than a class.
It can still be used as a class base, as described above.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.11: Added support for generic namedtuples.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.14: Using [`super()`](functions.md#super) (and the `__class__` [closure variable](../glossary.md#term-closure-variable)) in methods of `NamedTuple` subclasses
is unsupported and causes a [`TypeError`](exceptions.md#TypeError).

### *class* typing.NewType(name, tp)

Helper class to create low-overhead [distinct types](#distinct).

A `NewType` is considered a distinct type by a typechecker. At runtime,
however, calling a `NewType` returns its argument unchanged.

Usage:

```python3
UserId = NewType('UserId', int)  # Declare the NewType "UserId"
first_user = UserId(1)  # "UserId" returns the argument unchanged at runtime
```

#### \_\_module_\_

The name of the module in which the new type is defined.

#### \_\_name_\_

The name of the new type.

#### \_\_supertype_\_

The type that the new type is based on.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.5.2.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.10: `NewType` is now a class rather than a function.

### *class* typing.Protocol(Generic)

Base class for protocol classes.

Protocol classes are defined like this:

```python3
class Proto(Protocol):
    def meth(self) -> int:
        ...
```

Such classes are primarily used with static type checkers that recognize
structural subtyping (static duck-typing), for example:

```python3
class C:
    def meth(self) -> int:
        return 0

def func(x: Proto) -> int:
    return x.meth()

func(C())  # Passes static type check
```

See [**PEP 544**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0544/) for more details. Protocol classes decorated with
[`runtime_checkable()`](#typing.runtime_checkable) (described later) act as simple-minded runtime
protocols that check only the presence of given attributes, ignoring their
type signatures. Protocol classes without this decorator cannot be used
as the second argument to [`isinstance()`](functions.md#isinstance) or [`issubclass()`](functions.md#issubclass).

Protocol classes can be generic, for example:

```python3
class GenProto[T](Protocol):
    def meth(self) -> T:
        ...
```

In code that needs to be compatible with Python 3.11 or older, generic
Protocols can be written as follows:

```python3
T = TypeVar("T")

class GenProto(Protocol[T]):
    def meth(self) -> T:
        ...
```

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.8.

#### Deprecated-removed
Deprecated since version 3.15, will be removed in version 3.20: It is deprecated to call [`isinstance()`](functions.md#isinstance) and [`issubclass()`](functions.md#issubclass) checks on
protocol classes that were not explicitly decorated with `runtime_checkable()`
but that inherit from a runtime-checkable protocol class. This will throw
a [`TypeError`](exceptions.md#TypeError) in Python 3.20.

### @typing.runtime_checkable

Mark a protocol class as a runtime protocol.

Such a protocol can be used with [`isinstance()`](functions.md#isinstance) and [`issubclass()`](functions.md#issubclass).
This allows a simple-minded structural check, very similar to “one trick ponies”
in [`collections.abc`](collections.abc.md#module-collections.abc) such as [`Iterable`](collections.abc.md#collections.abc.Iterable).  For example:

```python3
@runtime_checkable
class Closable(Protocol):
    def close(self): ...

assert isinstance(open('/some/file'), Closable)

@runtime_checkable
class Named(Protocol):
    name: str

import threading
assert isinstance(threading.Thread(name='Bob'), Named)
```

Runtime checkability of protocols is not inherited. A subclass of a runtime-checkable protocol
is only runtime-checkable if it is explicitly marked as such, regardless of class hierarchy:

```python3
@runtime_checkable
class Iterable(Protocol):
    def __iter__(self): ...

# Without @runtime_checkable, Reversible would no longer be runtime-checkable.
@runtime_checkable
class Reversible(Iterable, Protocol):
    def __reversed__(self): ...
```

This decorator raises [`TypeError`](exceptions.md#TypeError) when applied to a non-protocol class.

#### NOTE
`runtime_checkable()` will check only the presence of the required
methods or attributes, not their type signatures or types.
For example, [`ssl.SSLObject`](ssl.md#ssl.SSLObject)
is a class, therefore it passes an [`issubclass()`](functions.md#issubclass)
check against [Callable](#annotating-callables). However, the
`ssl.SSLObject.__init__` method exists only to raise a
[`TypeError`](exceptions.md#TypeError) with a more informative message, therefore making
it impossible to call (instantiate) [`ssl.SSLObject`](ssl.md#ssl.SSLObject).

#### NOTE
An [`isinstance()`](functions.md#isinstance) check against a runtime-checkable protocol can be
surprisingly slow compared to an `isinstance()` check against
a non-protocol class. Consider using alternative idioms such as
[`hasattr()`](functions.md#hasattr) calls for structural checks in performance-sensitive
code.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.8.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.12: The internal implementation of [`isinstance()`](functions.md#isinstance) checks against
runtime-checkable protocols now uses [`inspect.getattr_static()`](inspect.md#inspect.getattr_static)
to look up attributes (previously, [`hasattr()`](functions.md#hasattr) was used).
As a result, some objects which used to be considered instances
of a runtime-checkable protocol may no longer be considered instances
of that protocol on Python 3.12+, and vice versa.
Most users are unlikely to be affected by this change.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.12: The members of a runtime-checkable protocol are now considered “frozen”
at runtime as soon as the class has been created. Monkey-patching
attributes onto a runtime-checkable protocol will still work, but will
have no impact on [`isinstance()`](functions.md#isinstance) checks comparing objects to the
protocol. See [What’s new in Python 3.12](../whatsnew/3.12.md#whatsnew-typing-py312)
for more details.

#### Deprecated-removed
Deprecated since version 3.15, will be removed in version 3.20: It is deprecated to call [`isinstance()`](functions.md#isinstance) and [`issubclass()`](functions.md#issubclass) checks on
protocol classes that were not explicitly decorated with `runtime_checkable()`
but that inherit from a runtime-checkable protocol class. This will throw
a [`TypeError`](exceptions.md#TypeError) in Python 3.20.

### *class* typing.TypedDict(dict)

Special construct to add type hints to a dictionary.
At runtime “`TypedDict` instances” are simply [`dicts`](stdtypes.md#dict).

`TypedDict` declares a dictionary type that expects all of its
instances to have a certain set of keys, where each key is
associated with a value of a consistent type. This expectation
is not checked at runtime but is only enforced by type checkers.
Usage:

```python3
class Point2D(TypedDict):
    x: int
    y: int
    label: str

a: Point2D = {'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'label': 'good'}  # OK
b: Point2D = {'z': 3, 'label': 'bad'}           # Fails type check

assert Point2D(x=1, y=2, label='first') == dict(x=1, y=2, label='first')
```

An alternative way to create a `TypedDict` is by using
function-call syntax. The second argument must be a literal [`dict`](stdtypes.md#dict):

```python3
Point2D = TypedDict('Point2D', {'x': int, 'y': int, 'label': str})
```

This functional syntax allows defining keys which are not valid
[identifiers](../reference/lexical_analysis.md#identifiers), for example because they are
keywords or contain hyphens, or when key names must not be
[mangled](../reference/expressions.md#private-name-mangling) like regular private names:

```python3
# raises SyntaxError
class Point2D(TypedDict):
    in: int  # 'in' is a keyword
    x-y: int  # name with hyphens

class Definition(TypedDict):
    __schema: str  # mangled to `_Definition__schema`

# OK, functional syntax
Point2D = TypedDict('Point2D', {'in': int, 'x-y': int})
Definition = TypedDict('Definition', {'__schema': str})  # not mangled
```

By default, all keys must be present in a `TypedDict`. It is possible to
mark individual keys as non-required using [`NotRequired`](#typing.NotRequired):

```python3
class Point2D(TypedDict):
    x: int
    y: int
    label: NotRequired[str]

# Alternative syntax
Point2D = TypedDict('Point2D', {'x': int, 'y': int, 'label': NotRequired[str]})
```

This means that a `Point2D` `TypedDict` can have the `label`
key omitted.

It is also possible to mark all keys as non-required by default
by specifying a totality of `False`:

```python3
class Point2D(TypedDict, total=False):
    x: int
    y: int

# Alternative syntax
Point2D = TypedDict('Point2D', {'x': int, 'y': int}, total=False)
```

This means that a `Point2D` `TypedDict` can have any of the keys
omitted. A type checker is only expected to support a literal `False` or
`True` as the value of the `total` argument. `True` is the default,
and makes all items defined in the class body required.

Individual keys of a `total=False` `TypedDict` can be marked as
required using [`Required`](#typing.Required):

```python3
class Point2D(TypedDict, total=False):
    x: Required[int]
    y: Required[int]
    label: str

# Alternative syntax
Point2D = TypedDict('Point2D', {
    'x': Required[int],
    'y': Required[int],
    'label': str
}, total=False)
```

It is possible for a `TypedDict` type to inherit from one or more other `TypedDict` types
using the class-based syntax.
Usage:

```python3
class Point3D(Point2D):
    z: int
```

`Point3D` has three items: `x`, `y` and `z`. It is equivalent to this
definition:

```python3
class Point3D(TypedDict):
    x: int
    y: int
    z: int
```

A `TypedDict` cannot inherit from a non-`TypedDict` class,
except for [`Generic`](#typing.Generic). For example:

```python3
class X(TypedDict):
    x: int

class Y(TypedDict):
    y: int

class Z(object): pass  # A non-TypedDict class

class XY(X, Y): pass  # OK

class XZ(X, Z): pass  # raises TypeError
```

A `TypedDict` can be generic:

```python3
class Group[T](TypedDict):
    key: T
    group: list[T]
```

To create a generic `TypedDict` that is compatible with Python 3.11
or lower, inherit from [`Generic`](#typing.Generic) explicitly:

```python
T = TypeVar("T")

class Group(TypedDict, Generic[T]):
    key: T
    group: list[T]
```

A `TypedDict` can be introspected via annotations dicts
(see [Annotations Best Practices](../howto/annotations.md#annotations-howto) for more information on annotations best practices),
[`__total__`](#typing.TypedDict.__total__), [`__required_keys__`](#typing.TypedDict.__required_keys__), and [`__optional_keys__`](#typing.TypedDict.__optional_keys__).

#### \_\_total_\_

`Point2D.__total__` gives the value of the `total` argument.
Example:

```pycon
>>> from typing import TypedDict
>>> class Point2D(TypedDict): pass
>>> Point2D.__total__
True
>>> class Point2D(TypedDict, total=False): pass
>>> Point2D.__total__
False
>>> class Point3D(Point2D): pass
>>> Point3D.__total__
True
```

This attribute reflects *only* the value of the `total` argument
to the current `TypedDict` class, not whether the class is semantically
total. For example, a `TypedDict` with `__total__` set to `True` may
have keys marked with [`NotRequired`](#typing.NotRequired), or it may inherit from another
`TypedDict` with `total=False`. Therefore, it is generally better to use
[`__required_keys__`](#typing.TypedDict.__required_keys__) and [`__optional_keys__`](#typing.TypedDict.__optional_keys__) for introspection.

#### \_\_required_keys_\_

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.9.

#### \_\_optional_keys_\_

`Point2D.__required_keys__` and `Point2D.__optional_keys__` return
[`frozenset`](stdtypes.md#frozenset) objects containing required and non-required keys, respectively.

Keys marked with [`Required`](#typing.Required) will always appear in `__required_keys__`
and keys marked with [`NotRequired`](#typing.NotRequired) will always appear in `__optional_keys__`.

For backwards compatibility with Python 3.10 and below,
it is also possible to use inheritance to declare both required and
non-required keys in the same `TypedDict` . This is done by declaring a
`TypedDict` with one value for the `total` argument and then
inheriting from it in another `TypedDict` with a different value for
`total`:

```pycon
>>> class Point2D(TypedDict, total=False):
...     x: int
...     y: int
...
>>> class Point3D(Point2D):
...     z: int
...
>>> Point3D.__required_keys__ == frozenset({'z'})
True
>>> Point3D.__optional_keys__ == frozenset({'x', 'y'})
True
```

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.9.

#### NOTE
If `from __future__ import annotations` is used or if annotations
are given as strings, annotations are not evaluated when the
`TypedDict` is defined. Therefore, the runtime introspection that
`__required_keys__` and `__optional_keys__` rely on may not work
properly, and the values of the attributes may be incorrect.

Support for [`ReadOnly`](#typing.ReadOnly) is reflected in the following attributes:

#### \_\_readonly_keys_\_

A [`frozenset`](stdtypes.md#frozenset) containing the names of all read-only keys. Keys
are read-only if they carry the [`ReadOnly`](#typing.ReadOnly) qualifier.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.13.

#### \_\_mutable_keys_\_

A [`frozenset`](stdtypes.md#frozenset) containing the names of all mutable keys. Keys
are mutable if they do not carry the [`ReadOnly`](#typing.ReadOnly) qualifier.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.13.

See the [TypedDict](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/typeddict.html#typeddict) section in the typing documentation for more examples and detailed rules.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.8.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.9: `TypedDict` is now a function rather than a class.
It can still be used as a class base, as described above.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.11: Added support for marking individual keys as [`Required`](#typing.Required) or [`NotRequired`](#typing.NotRequired).
See [**PEP 655**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0655/).

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.11: Added support for generic `TypedDict`s.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.13: Removed support for the keyword-argument method of creating `TypedDict`s.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.13: Support for the [`ReadOnly`](#typing.ReadOnly) qualifier was added.

### Protocols

The following protocols are provided by the `typing` module. All are decorated
with [`@runtime_checkable`](#typing.runtime_checkable).

### *class* typing.SupportsAbs

An ABC with one abstract method `__abs__` that is covariant
in its return type.

### *class* typing.SupportsBytes

An ABC with one abstract method `__bytes__`.

### *class* typing.SupportsComplex

An ABC with one abstract method `__complex__`.

### *class* typing.SupportsFloat

An ABC with one abstract method `__float__`.

### *class* typing.SupportsIndex

An ABC with one abstract method `__index__`.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.8.

### *class* typing.SupportsInt

An ABC with one abstract method `__int__`.

### *class* typing.SupportsRound

An ABC with one abstract method `__round__`
that is covariant in its return type.

<a id="typing-io"></a>

### ABCs and Protocols for working with I/O

### *class* typing.IO

### *class* typing.TextIO

### *class* typing.BinaryIO

Generic class `IO[AnyStr]` and its subclasses `TextIO(IO[str])`
and `BinaryIO(IO[bytes])`
represent the types of I/O streams such as returned by
[`open()`](functions.md#open). Please note that these classes are not protocols, and
their interface is fairly broad.

The protocols [`io.Reader`](io.md#io.Reader) and [`io.Writer`](io.md#io.Writer) offer a simpler
alternative for argument types, when only the `read()` or `write()`
methods are accessed, respectively:

```python3
def read_and_write(reader: Reader[str], writer: Writer[bytes]):
    data = reader.read()
    writer.write(data.encode())
```

Also consider using [`collections.abc.Iterable`](collections.abc.md#collections.abc.Iterable) for iterating over
the lines of an input stream:

```python3
def read_config(stream: Iterable[str]):
    for line in stream:
        ...
```

### Functions and decorators

### typing.cast(typ, val)

Cast a value to a type.

This returns the value unchanged.  To the type checker this
signals that the return value has the designated type, but at
runtime we intentionally don’t check anything (we want this
to be as fast as possible).

### typing.assert_type(val, typ,)

Ask a static type checker to confirm that *val* has an inferred type of *typ*.

At runtime this does nothing: it returns the first argument unchanged with no
checks or side effects, no matter the actual type of the argument.

When a static type checker encounters a call to `assert_type()`, it
emits an error if the value is not of the specified type:

```python3
def greet(name: str) -> None:
    assert_type(name, str)  # OK, inferred type of `name` is `str`
    assert_type(name, int)  # type checker error
```

This function is useful for ensuring the type checker’s understanding of a
script is in line with the developer’s intentions:

```python3
def complex_function(arg: object):
    # Do some complex type-narrowing logic,
    # after which we hope the inferred type will be `int`
    ...
    # Test whether the type checker correctly understands our function
    assert_type(arg, int)
```

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.11.

### typing.assert_never(arg,)

Ask a static type checker to confirm that a line of code is unreachable.

Example:

```python3
def int_or_str(arg: int | str) -> None:
    match arg:
        case int():
            print("It's an int")
        case str():
            print("It's a str")
        case _ as unreachable:
            assert_never(unreachable)
```

Here, the annotations allow the type checker to infer that the
last case can never execute, because `arg` is either
an [`int`](functions.md#int) or a [`str`](stdtypes.md#str), and both options are covered by
earlier cases.

If a type checker finds that a call to `assert_never()` is
reachable, it will emit an error. For example, if the type annotation
for `arg` was instead `int | str | float`, the type checker would
emit an error pointing out that `unreachable` is of type [`float`](functions.md#float).
For a call to `assert_never` to pass type checking, the inferred type of
the argument passed in must be the bottom type, [`Never`](#typing.Never), and nothing
else.

At runtime, this throws an exception when called.

#### SEE ALSO
[Unreachable Code and Exhaustiveness Checking](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/guides/unreachable.html) has more
information about exhaustiveness checking with static typing.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.11.

### typing.reveal_type(obj,)

Ask a static type checker to reveal the inferred type of an expression.

When a static type checker encounters a call to this function,
it emits a diagnostic with the inferred type of the argument. For example:

```python3
x: int = 1
reveal_type(x)  # Revealed type is "builtins.int"
```

This can be useful when you want to debug how your type checker
handles a particular piece of code.

At runtime, this function prints the runtime type of its argument to
[`sys.stderr`](sys.md#sys.stderr) and returns the argument unchanged (allowing the call to
be used within an expression):

```python3
x = reveal_type(1)  # prints "Runtime type is int"
print(x)  # prints "1"
```

Note that the runtime type may be different from (more or less specific
than) the type statically inferred by a type checker.

Most type checkers support `reveal_type()` anywhere, even if the
name is not imported from `typing`. Importing the name from
`typing`, however, allows your code to run without runtime errors and
communicates intent more clearly.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.11.

### @typing.dataclass_transform(, eq_default=True, order_default=False, kw_only_default=False, frozen_default=False, field_specifiers=(), \*\*kwargs)

Decorator to mark an object as providing
[`dataclass`](dataclasses.md#dataclasses.dataclass)-like behavior.

`dataclass_transform` may be used to
decorate a class, metaclass, or a function that is itself a decorator.
The presence of `@dataclass_transform()` tells a static type checker that the
decorated object performs runtime “magic” that
transforms a class in a similar way to
[`@dataclasses.dataclass`](dataclasses.md#dataclasses.dataclass).

Example usage with a decorator function:

```python
@dataclass_transform()
def create_model[T](cls: type[T]) -> type[T]:
    ...
    return cls

@create_model
class CustomerModel:
    id: int
    name: str
```

On a base class:

```python3
@dataclass_transform()
class ModelBase: ...

class CustomerModel(ModelBase):
    id: int
    name: str
```

On a metaclass:

```python3
@dataclass_transform()
class ModelMeta(type): ...

class ModelBase(metaclass=ModelMeta): ...

class CustomerModel(ModelBase):
    id: int
    name: str
```

The `CustomerModel` classes defined above will
be treated by type checkers similarly to classes created with
[`@dataclasses.dataclass`](dataclasses.md#dataclasses.dataclass).
For example, type checkers will assume these classes have
`__init__` methods that accept `id` and `name`.

The decorated class, metaclass, or function may accept the following bool
arguments which type checkers will assume have the same effect as they
would have on the
[`@dataclasses.dataclass`](dataclasses.md#dataclasses.dataclass) decorator: `init`,
`eq`, `order`, `unsafe_hash`, `frozen`, `match_args`,
`kw_only`, and `slots`. It must be possible for the value of these
arguments (`True` or `False`) to be statically evaluated.

The arguments to the `dataclass_transform` decorator can be used to
customize the default behaviors of the decorated class, metaclass, or
function:

* **Parameters:**
  * **eq_default** ([*bool*](functions.md#bool)) – Indicates whether the `eq` parameter is assumed to be
    `True` or `False` if it is omitted by the caller.
    Defaults to `True`.
  * **order_default** ([*bool*](functions.md#bool)) – Indicates whether the `order` parameter is
    assumed to be `True` or `False` if it is omitted by the caller.
    Defaults to `False`.
  * **kw_only_default** ([*bool*](functions.md#bool)) – Indicates whether the `kw_only` parameter is
    assumed to be `True` or `False` if it is omitted by the caller.
    Defaults to `False`.
  * **frozen_default** ([*bool*](functions.md#bool)) – 

    Indicates whether the `frozen` parameter is
    assumed to be `True` or `False` if it is omitted by the caller.
    Defaults to `False`.

    #### Versionadded
    Added in version 3.12.
  * **field_specifiers** ([*tuple*](stdtypes.md#tuple) *[*[*Callable*](collections.abc.md#collections.abc.Callable) *[* *...* *,* [*Any*](#typing.Any) *]* *,*  *...* *]*) – Specifies a static list of supported classes
    or functions that describe fields, similar to [`dataclasses.field()`](dataclasses.md#dataclasses.field).
    Defaults to `()`.
  * **\*\*kwargs** ([*Any*](#typing.Any)) – Arbitrary other keyword arguments are accepted in order to allow for
    possible future extensions.

Type checkers recognize the following optional parameters on field
specifiers:

#### **Recognised parameters for field specifiers**

| Parameter name    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `init`            | Indicates whether the field should be included in the<br/>synthesized `__init__` method. If unspecified, `init` defaults to<br/>`True`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `default`         | Provides the default value for the field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `default_factory` | Provides a runtime callback that returns the<br/>default value for the field. If neither `default` nor<br/>`default_factory` are specified, the field is assumed to have no<br/>default value and must be provided a value when the class is<br/>instantiated.                                                                                                                               |
| `factory`         | An alias for the `default_factory` parameter on field specifiers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `kw_only`         | Indicates whether the field should be marked as<br/>keyword-only. If `True`, the field will be keyword-only. If<br/>`False`, it will not be keyword-only. If unspecified, the value of<br/>the `kw_only` parameter on the object decorated with<br/>`dataclass_transform` will be used, or if that is unspecified, the<br/>value of `kw_only_default` on `dataclass_transform` will be used. |
| `alias`           | Provides an alternative name for the field. This alternative<br/>name is used in the synthesized `__init__` method.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

At runtime, this decorator records its arguments in the
`__dataclass_transform__` attribute on the decorated object.
It has no other runtime effect.

See [**PEP 681**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0681/) for more details.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.11.

<a id="overload"></a>

### @typing.overload

Decorator for creating overloaded functions and methods.

The `@overload` decorator allows describing functions and methods
that support multiple different combinations of argument types. A series
of `@overload`-decorated definitions must be followed by exactly one
non-`@overload`-decorated definition (for the same function/method).

`@overload`-decorated definitions are for the benefit of the
type checker only, since they will be overwritten by the
non-`@overload`-decorated definition. The non-`@overload`-decorated
definition, meanwhile, will be used at
runtime but should be ignored by a type checker.  At runtime, calling
an `@overload`-decorated function directly will raise
[`NotImplementedError`](exceptions.md#NotImplementedError).

An example of overload that gives a more
precise type than can be expressed using a union or a type variable:

```python
@overload
def process(response: None) -> None:
    ...
@overload
def process(response: int) -> tuple[int, str]:
    ...
@overload
def process(response: bytes) -> str:
    ...
def process(response):
    ...  # actual implementation goes here
```

See [**PEP 484**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/) for more details and comparison with other typing semantics.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.11: Overloaded functions can now be introspected at runtime using
[`get_overloads()`](#typing.get_overloads).

### typing.get_overloads(func)

Return a sequence of [`@overload`](#typing.overload)-decorated definitions for
*func*.

*func* is the function object for the implementation of the
overloaded function. For example, given the definition of `process` in
the documentation for [`@overload`](#typing.overload),
`get_overloads(process)` will return a sequence of three function objects
for the three defined overloads. If called on a function with no overloads,
`get_overloads()` returns an empty sequence.

`get_overloads()` can be used for introspecting an overloaded function at
runtime.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.11.

### typing.clear_overloads()

Clear all registered overloads in the internal registry.

This can be used to reclaim the memory used by the registry.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.11.

### @typing.final

Decorator to indicate final methods and final classes.

Decorating a method with `@final` indicates to a type checker that the
method cannot be overridden in a subclass. Decorating a class with `@final`
indicates that it cannot be subclassed.

For example:

```python3
class Base:
    @final
    def done(self) -> None:
        ...
class Sub(Base):
    def done(self) -> None:  # Error reported by type checker
        ...

@final
class Leaf:
    ...
class Other(Leaf):  # Error reported by type checker
    ...
```

There is no runtime checking of these properties. See [**PEP 591**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0591/) for
more details.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.8.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.11: The decorator will now attempt to set a `__final__` attribute to `True`
on the decorated object. Thus, a check like
`if getattr(obj, "__final__", False)` can be used at runtime
to determine whether an object `obj` has been marked as final.
If the decorated object does not support setting attributes,
the decorator returns the object unchanged without raising an exception.

### @typing.no_type_check

Decorator to indicate that annotations are not type hints.

This works as a class or function [decorator](../glossary.md#term-decorator).  With a class, it
applies recursively to all methods and classes defined in that class
(but not to methods defined in its superclasses or subclasses). Type
checkers will ignore all annotations in a function or class with this
decorator.

`@no_type_check` mutates the decorated object in place.

### @typing.override

Decorator to indicate that a method in a subclass is intended to override a
method or attribute in a superclass.

Type checkers should emit an error if a method decorated with `@override`
does not, in fact, override anything.
This helps prevent bugs that may occur when a base class is changed without
an equivalent change to a child class.

For example:

```python
class Base:
    def log_status(self) -> None:
        ...

class Sub(Base):
    @override
    def log_status(self) -> None:  # Okay: overrides Base.log_status
        ...

    @override
    def done(self) -> None:  # Error reported by type checker
        ...
```

There is no runtime checking of this property.

The decorator will attempt to set an `__override__` attribute to `True` on
the decorated object. Thus, a check like
`if getattr(obj, "__override__", False)` can be used at runtime to determine
whether an object `obj` has been marked as an override.  If the decorated object
does not support setting attributes, the decorator returns the object unchanged
without raising an exception.

See [**PEP 698**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0698/) for more details.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.12.

### @typing.disjoint_base

Decorator to mark a class as a disjoint base.

Type checkers do not allow child classes of a disjoint base `C` to
inherit from other disjoint bases that are not parent or child classes of `C`.

For example:

```python3
@disjoint_base
class Disjoint1: pass

@disjoint_base
class Disjoint2: pass

class Disjoint3(Disjoint1, Disjoint2): pass  # Type checker error
```

Type checkers can use knowledge of disjoint bases to detect unreachable code
and determine when two types can overlap.

The corresponding runtime concept is a solid base (see [Multiple inheritance](../reference/compound_stmts.md#multiple-inheritance)).
Classes that are solid bases at runtime can be marked with `@disjoint_base` in stub files.
Users may also mark other classes as disjoint bases to indicate to type checkers that
multiple inheritance with other disjoint bases should not be allowed.

Note that the concept of a solid base is a CPython implementation
detail, and the exact set of standard library classes that are
disjoint bases at runtime may change in future versions of Python.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.15.0a8 (unreleased).

### @typing.type_check_only

Decorator to mark a class or function as unavailable at runtime.

This decorator is itself not available at runtime. It is mainly
intended to mark classes that are defined in type stub files if
an implementation returns an instance of a private class:

```python3
@type_check_only
class Response:  # private or not available at runtime
    code: int
    def get_header(self, name: str) -> str: ...

def fetch_response() -> Response: ...
```

Note that returning instances of private classes is not recommended.
It is usually preferable to make such classes public.

### Introspection helpers

### typing.get_type_hints(obj, globalns=None, localns=None, include_extras=False, , format=Format.VALUE)

Return a dictionary containing type hints for a function, method, module,
class object, or other callable object.

This is often the same as [`annotationlib.get_annotations()`](annotationlib.md#annotationlib.get_annotations), but this
function makes the following changes to the annotations dictionary:

* Forward references encoded as string literals or [`ForwardRef`](#typing.ForwardRef)
  objects are handled by evaluating them in *globalns*, *localns*, and
  (where applicable) *obj*’s [type parameter](../reference/compound_stmts.md#type-params) namespace.
  If *globalns* or *localns* is not given, appropriate namespace
  dictionaries are inferred from *obj*.
* `None` is replaced with [`types.NoneType`](types.md#types.NoneType).
* If [`@no_type_check`](#typing.no_type_check) has been applied to *obj*, an
  empty dictionary is returned.
* If *obj* is a class `C`, the function returns a dictionary that merges
  annotations from `C`’s base classes with those on `C` directly. This
  is done by traversing [`C.__mro__`](../reference/datamodel.md#type.__mro__) and iteratively
  combining
  [annotations](../glossary.md#term-variable-annotation) of each base class. Annotations
  on classes appearing earlier in the [method resolution order](../glossary.md#term-method-resolution-order) always
  take precedence over annotations on classes appearing later in the method
  resolution order.
* The function recursively replaces all occurrences of
  `Annotated[T, ...]`, `Required[T]`, `NotRequired[T]`, and `ReadOnly[T]`
  with `T`, unless *include_extras* is set to `True` (see
  [`Annotated`](#typing.Annotated) for more information).

#### NOTE
If [`Format.VALUE`](annotationlib.md#annotationlib.Format.VALUE) is used and any
forward references in the annotations of *obj* are not resolvable, a
[`NameError`](exceptions.md#NameError) exception is raised. For example, this can happen
with names imported under [`if TYPE_CHECKING`](#typing.TYPE_CHECKING).
More generally, any kind of exception can be raised if an annotation
contains invalid Python code.

#### NOTE
Calling [`get_type_hints()`](#typing.get_type_hints) on an instance is not supported.
To retrieve annotations for an instance, call
[`get_type_hints()`](#typing.get_type_hints) on the instance’s class instead
(for example, `get_type_hints(type(obj))`).

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.9: Added `include_extras` parameter as part of [**PEP 593**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0593/).
See the documentation on [`Annotated`](#typing.Annotated) for more information.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.11: Previously, `Optional[t]` was added for function and method annotations
if a default value equal to `None` was set.
Now the annotation is returned unchanged.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.14: Added the `format` parameter. See the documentation on
[`annotationlib.get_annotations()`](annotationlib.md#annotationlib.get_annotations) for more information.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.14: Calling [`get_type_hints()`](#typing.get_type_hints) on instances is no longer supported.
Some instances were accepted in earlier versions as an undocumented
implementation detail.

### typing.get_origin(tp)

Get the unsubscripted version of a type: for a typing object of the form
`X[Y, Z, ...]` return `X`.

If `X` is a typing-module alias for a builtin or
[`collections`](collections.md#module-collections) class, it will be normalized to the original class.
If `X` is an instance of [`ParamSpecArgs`](#typing.ParamSpecArgs) or [`ParamSpecKwargs`](#typing.ParamSpecKwargs),
return the underlying [`ParamSpec`](#typing.ParamSpec).
Return `None` for unsupported objects.

Examples:

```python
assert get_origin(str) is None
assert get_origin(Dict[str, int]) is dict
assert get_origin(Union[int, str]) is Union
assert get_origin(Annotated[str, "metadata"]) is Annotated
P = ParamSpec('P')
assert get_origin(P.args) is P
assert get_origin(P.kwargs) is P
```

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.8.

### typing.get_args(tp)

Get type arguments with all substitutions performed: for a typing object
of the form `X[Y, Z, ...]` return `(Y, Z, ...)`.

If `X` is a union or [`Literal`](#typing.Literal) contained in another
generic type, the order of `(Y, Z, ...)` may be different from the order
of the original arguments `[Y, Z, ...]` due to type caching.
Return `()` for unsupported objects.

Examples:

```python
assert get_args(int) == ()
assert get_args(Dict[int, str]) == (int, str)
assert get_args(Union[int, str]) == (int, str)
```

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.8.

### typing.get_protocol_members(tp)

Return the set of members defined in a [`Protocol`](#typing.Protocol).

```pycon
>>> from typing import Protocol, get_protocol_members
>>> class P(Protocol):
...     def a(self) -> str: ...
...     b: int
>>> get_protocol_members(P) == frozenset({'a', 'b'})
True
```

Raise [`TypeError`](exceptions.md#TypeError) for arguments that are not Protocols.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.13.

### typing.is_protocol(tp)

Determine if a type is a [`Protocol`](#typing.Protocol).

For example:

```python3
class P(Protocol):
    def a(self) -> str: ...
    b: int

is_protocol(P)    # => True
is_protocol(int)  # => False
```

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.13.

### typing.is_typeddict(tp)

Check if a type is a [`TypedDict`](#typing.TypedDict).

For example:

```python
class Film(TypedDict):
    title: str
    year: int

assert is_typeddict(Film)
assert not is_typeddict(list | str)

# TypedDict is a factory for creating typed dicts,
# not a typed dict itself
assert not is_typeddict(TypedDict)
```

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.10.

### *class* typing.ForwardRef

Class used for internal typing representation of string forward references.

For example, `List["SomeClass"]` is implicitly transformed into
`List[ForwardRef("SomeClass")]`.  `ForwardRef` should not be instantiated by
a user, but may be used by introspection tools.

#### NOTE
[**PEP 585**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/) generic types such as `list["SomeClass"]` will not be
implicitly transformed into `list[ForwardRef("SomeClass")]` and thus
will not automatically resolve to `list[SomeClass]`.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.7.4.

#### Versionchanged
Changed in version 3.14: This is now an alias for [`annotationlib.ForwardRef`](annotationlib.md#annotationlib.ForwardRef). Several undocumented
behaviors of this class have been changed; for example, after a `ForwardRef` has
been evaluated, the evaluated value is no longer cached.

### typing.evaluate_forward_ref(forward_ref, , owner=None, globals=None, locals=None, type_params=None, format=annotationlib.Format.VALUE)

Evaluate an [`annotationlib.ForwardRef`](annotationlib.md#annotationlib.ForwardRef) as a [type hint](../glossary.md#term-type-hint).

This is similar to calling [`annotationlib.ForwardRef.evaluate()`](annotationlib.md#annotationlib.ForwardRef.evaluate),
but unlike that method, `evaluate_forward_ref()` also
recursively evaluates forward references nested within the type hint.

See the documentation for [`annotationlib.ForwardRef.evaluate()`](annotationlib.md#annotationlib.ForwardRef.evaluate) for
the meaning of the *owner*, *globals*, *locals*, *type_params*, and *format* parameters.

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.14.

### typing.NoDefault

A sentinel object used to indicate that a type parameter has no default
value. For example:

```pycon
>>> T = TypeVar("T")
>>> T.__default__ is typing.NoDefault
True
>>> S = TypeVar("S", default=None)
>>> S.__default__ is None
True
```

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.13.

### Constant

### typing.TYPE_CHECKING

A special constant that is assumed to be `True` by 3rd party static
type checkers. It’s `False` at runtime.

A module which is expensive to import, and which only contain types
used for typing annotations, can be safely imported inside an
`if TYPE_CHECKING:` block.  This prevents the module from actually
being imported at runtime; annotations aren’t eagerly evaluated
(see [**PEP 649**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0649/)) so using undefined symbols in annotations is
harmless–as long as you don’t later examine them.
Your static type analysis tool will set `TYPE_CHECKING` to
`True` during static type analysis, which means the module will
be imported and the types will be checked properly during such analysis.

Usage:

```python3
if TYPE_CHECKING:
    import expensive_mod

def fun(arg: expensive_mod.SomeType) -> None:
    local_var: expensive_mod.AnotherType = other_fun()
```

If you occasionally need to examine type annotations at runtime
which may contain undefined symbols, use
[`annotationlib.get_annotations()`](annotationlib.md#annotationlib.get_annotations) with a `format` parameter
of [`annotationlib.Format.STRING`](annotationlib.md#annotationlib.Format.STRING) or
[`annotationlib.Format.FORWARDREF`](annotationlib.md#annotationlib.Format.FORWARDREF) to safely retrieve the
annotations without raising [`NameError`](exceptions.md#NameError).

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.5.2.

### Deprecated aliases

This module defines several deprecated aliases to pre-existing
standard library classes. These were originally included in the `typing`
module in order to support parameterizing these generic classes using `[]`.
However, the aliases became redundant in Python 3.9 when the
corresponding pre-existing classes were enhanced to support `[]` (see
[**PEP 585**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/)).

The redundant types are deprecated as of Python 3.9. However, while the aliases
may be removed at some point, removal of these aliases is not currently
planned. As such, no deprecation warnings are currently issued by the
interpreter for these aliases.

If at some point it is decided to remove these deprecated aliases, a
deprecation warning will be issued by the interpreter for at least two releases
prior to removal. The aliases are guaranteed to remain in the `typing` module
without deprecation warnings until at least Python 3.14.

Type checkers are encouraged to flag uses of the deprecated types if the
program they are checking targets a minimum Python version of 3.9 or newer.

#### Aliases to other concrete types

### *class* typing.Pattern

### *class* typing.Match

Deprecated aliases corresponding to the return types from
[`re.compile()`](re.md#re.compile) and [`re.search()`](re.md#re.search).

These types (and the corresponding functions) are generic over
[`AnyStr`](#typing.AnyStr). `Pattern` can be specialised as `Pattern[str]` or
`Pattern[bytes]`; `Match` can be specialised as `Match[str]` or
`Match[bytes]`.

#### Deprecated

See [**PEP 585**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/) and [Generic Alias Type](stdtypes.md#types-genericalias).

### *class* typing.Text

Deprecated alias for [`str`](stdtypes.md#str).

`Text` is provided to supply a forward
compatible path for Python 2 code: in Python 2, `Text` is an alias for
`unicode`.

Use `Text` to indicate that a value must contain a unicode string in
a manner that is compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3:

```python3
def add_unicode_checkmark(text: Text) -> Text:
    return text + u' \u2713'
```

#### Versionadded
Added in version 3.5.2.

#### Deprecated
Deprecated since version 3.11: Python 2 is no longer supported, and most type checkers also no longer
support type checking Python 2 code. Removal of the alias is not
currently planned, but users are encouraged to use
[`str`](stdtypes.md#str) instead of `Text`.

<a id="corresponding-to-collections-in-collections-abc"></a>

#### Aliases to container ABCs in [`collections.abc`](collections.abc.md#module-collections.abc)

### *class* typing.AbstractSet(Collection[T_co])

Deprecated alias to [`collections.abc.Set`](collections.abc.md#collections.abc.Set).

#### Deprecated
Deprecated since version 3.9: [`collections.abc.Set`](collections.abc.md#collections.abc.Set) now supports subscripting (`[]`).
See [**PEP 585**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/) and [Generic Alias Type](stdtypes.md#types-genericalias).

### *class* typing.ByteString(Sequence[int])

Deprecated alias to [`collections.abc.ByteString`](collections.abc.md#collections.abc.ByteString).

Use `isinstance(obj, collections.abc.Buffer)` to test if `obj`
implements the [buffer protocol](../c-api/buffer.md#bufferobjects) at runtime. For use in
type annotations, either use [`Buffer`](collections.abc.md#collections.abc.Buffer) or a union
that explicitly specifies the types your code supports (e.g.,
`bytes | bytearray | memoryview`).

`ByteString` was originally intended to be an abstract class that
would serve as a supertype of both [`bytes`](stdtypes.md#bytes) and [`bytearray`](stdtypes.md#bytearray).
However, since the ABC never had any methods, knowing that an object was an
instance of `ByteString` never actually told you anything useful
about the object. Other common buffer types such as [`memoryview`](stdtypes.md#memoryview) were
also never understood as subtypes of `ByteString` (either at runtime
or by static type checkers).

See [**PEP 688**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0688/#current-options) for more details.

#### Deprecated-removed
Deprecated since version 3.9, will be removed in version 3.17.

## Deprecation Timeline of Major Features

Certain features in `typing` are deprecated and may be removed in a future
version of Python. The following table summarizes major deprecations for your
convenience. This is subject to change, and not all deprecations are listed.
